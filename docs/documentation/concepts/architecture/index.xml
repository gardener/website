It incorporates some of the requested features of the community but not yet all of them.
Caution: This software is early alpha. It is not meant for production use and shall (currently) only serve as a possible outlook of what is possible with pre-deployed software on Gardener Kubernetes clusters.
Installation If you want to deploy Bouquet on a target Gardener cluster, run the following:</description></item><item><title>Dashboard</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/components/dashboard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/components/dashboard/</guid><description>Gardener Dashboard

Gardener implements the automated management and operation of Kubernetes clusters as a service and provides a fully validated extensibility framework that can be adjusted to any programmatic cloud or infrastructure provider.
Gardener is 100% Kubernets-native and exposes its own Cluster API to create homogeneous clusters on all supported infrastructures. This API differs from SIG Cluster Lifecycle&amp;rsquo;s Cluster API that only harmonizes how to get to clusters, while Gardener&amp;rsquo;s Cluster API goes one step further and also harmonizes the make-up of the clusters themselves.</description></item><item><title>kubify</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/components/kubify/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/components/kubify/</guid><description>Kubify Kubify is a Terraform based provisioning project for setting up production ready Kubernetes clusters on public and private Cloud infrastructures.
