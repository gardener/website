The advantages of this approach are given below.</p><ul><li>The problem domain is smaller.
There are no leader election and quorum related issues to be handled.
It is simpler to setup and manage a single-node etcd cluster.</li><li>Single-node etcd clusters instances have <a href=https://etcd.io/docs/v2/admin_guide/#optimal-cluster-size>less request latency</a> than multi-node etcd clusters because there is no requirement to replicate the changes to the other members before committing the changes.</li><li><code>etcd-druid</code> provisions etcd cluster instances as pods (actually as <code>statefulsets</code>) in a Kubernetes cluster and Kubernetes is quick (&lt;<code>20s</code>) to restart container/pods if they go down.</li><li>Also, <code>etcd-druid</code> is currently only used by gardener to provision etcd clusters to act as back-ends for Kubernetes control-planes and Kubernetes control-plane components (<code>kube-apiserver</code>, <code>kubelet</code>, <code>kube-controller-manager</code>, <code>kube-scheduler</code> etc.) can tolerate etcd going down and recover when it comes back up.</li><li>Single-node etcd clusters incur less cost (CPU, memory and storage)</li><li>It is easy to cut-off client requests if backups fail by using <a href=https://github.com/gardener/etcd-druid/blob/eaf04a2d0e6c7a4f2c8c220182b7a141aabfc70b/charts/etcd/templates/etcd-statefulset.yaml#L54-L62><code>readinessProbe</code> on the <code>etcd-backup-restore</code> healthz endpoint</a> to minimize the gap between the latest revision and the backup revision.</li></ul><p>The disadvantages of using single-node etcd clusters are given below.</p><ul><li>The <a href=https://github.com/gardener/etcd-backup-restore/blob/master/doc/proposals/design.md#workflow>database verification</a> step by <code>etcd-backup-restore</code> can introduce additional delays whenever etcd container/pod restarts (in total ~<code>20-25s</code>).
This can be much longer if a database restoration is required.
Especially, if there are incremental snapshots that need to be replayed (this can be mitigated by <a href=https://github.com/gardener/etcd-druid/issues/88>compacting the incremental snapshots in the background</a>).</li><li>Kubernetes control-plane components can go into <code>CrashloopBackoff</code> if etcd is down for some time.

Also, some cloud providers (e.g. Azure) take a long time to attach/detach volumes to and from machines which increases the down time to the Kubernetes components that depend on etcd.
It is difficult to use ephemeral/local storage (to achieve better latency/throughput as well as to circumvent volume attachment/detachment) for single-node etcd cluster instances.</li></ul><h3 id=multi-node-etcd-cluster>Multi-node etcd-cluster</h3><p>The advantages of introducing support for multi-node etcd clusters via <code>etcd-druid</code> are below.</p><ul><li>Multi-node etcd cluster is highly-available.

This will necessarily still involve a down-time because scaling from a single-node etcd cluster to a three-node etcd cluster will involve etcd pod restarts, it is still probable that it can be managed with a shorter down time than we see at present for single-node etcd clusters (on the other hand, converting a three-node etcd cluster to five node etcd cluster can be non-disruptive).</p><p>This is <em>definitely not</em> to argue in favour of such a dynamic approach in all cases (eventually, if/when dynamic multi-node etcd clusters are supported).

Out of these, the static way is the simplest (and probably faster to bootstrap the cluster) and has the least external dependencies.
Hence, it is preferred in this proposal.
But it requires that the initial (during bootstrapping) etcd cluster size (number of members) is already known before bootstrapping and that all of the members are already addressable (DNS,IP,TLS etc.).
Such information needs to be passed to the individual members during startup using the following static configuration.</p><ul><li>ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER<ul><li>The list of peer URLs including all the members. This must be the same as the advertised peer URLs configuration. This can also be passed as <code>initial-cluster</code> flag to etcd.</li></ul></li><li>ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER_STATE<ul><li>This should be set to <code>new</code> while bootstrapping an etcd cluster.</li></ul></li><li>ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER_TOKEN<ul><li>This is a token to distinguish the etcd cluster from any other etcd cluster in the same network.</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id=assumptions>Assumptions</h4><ul><li>ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER can use DNS instead of IP addresses.

This is true in the case of etcd-druid setting up an etcd cluster using a single statefulset. But it may not necessarily be true in other cases (multiple statefulset per etcd cluster or deployments instead of statefulsets or in the case of etcd cluster with members distributed across more than one Kubernetes cluster.</li></ul><h3 id=adding-a-new-member-to-an-etcd-cluster>Adding a new member to an etcd cluster</h3><p>A <a href=https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/op-guide/runtime-configuration/#add-a-new-member>new member can be added</a> to an existing etcd cluster instance using the following steps.</p><ol><li>If the latest backup snapshot exists, restore the member&rsquo;s etcd data to the latest backup snapshot.

This is acceptable if the amount of incremental snapshots are managed to be relatively small.
This adds one more reason to increase the priority of the issue of <a href=https://github.com/gardener/etcd-druid/issues/88>incremental snapshot compaction</a>.</li><li>There is a time window, between the <code>MemberAdd</code> call and the new member joining the cluster and getting up to date, where the cluster is <a href=https://etcd.io/docs/v3.3.12/learning/learner/#background>vulnerable to leader elections which could be disruptive</a>.</li></ul><h4 id=alternative>Alternative</h4><p>With <code>v3.4</code>, the new <a href=https://etcd.io/docs/v3.3.12/learning/learner/#raft-learner>raft learner approach</a> can be used to mitigate some of the possible disruptions mentioned <a href=#note>above</a>.
Then the steps will be as follows.</p><ol><li>If the latest backup snapshot exists, restore the member&rsquo;s etcd data to the latest backup snapshot.

The actions that need to be taken to manage these failures depend on the failure mode.</p><h4 id=removing-an-existing-member-from-an-etcd-cluster>Removing an existing member from an etcd cluster</h4><p>If a member of an etcd cluster becomes unhealthy, it must be explicitly removed from the etcd cluster, as soon as possible.
This can be done by using the <a href=https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/6e800b9b0161ef874784fc6c679325acd67e2452/client/v3/cluster.go#L46><code>MemberRemove</code> API</a>.
This ensures that only healthy members participate as voting members.</p><p>A member of an etcd cluster may be removed not just for managing failures but also for other reasons such as -</p><ul><li>The etcd cluster is being scaled down. I.e. the cluster size is being reduced</li><li>An existing member is being replaced by a new one for some reason (e.g. upgrades)</li></ul><p>If the majority of the members of the etcd cluster are healthy and the member that is unhealthy/being removed happens to be the <a href=https://etcd.io/docs/v3.1.12/op-guide/failures/#leader-failure>leader</a> at that moment then the etcd cluster will automatically elect a new leader.
But if only a minority of etcd clusters are healthy after removing the member then the the cluster will no longer be <a href=https://etcd.io/docs/v3.1.12/op-guide/failures/#majority-failure>quorate</a> and will stop accepting write requests.
Such an etcd cluster needs to be recovered via some kind of <a href=#recovering-an-etcd-cluster-from-failure-of-majority-of-members>disaster-recovery</a>.</p><h4 id=restarting-an-existing-member-of-an-etcd-cluster>Restarting an existing member of an etcd cluster</h4><p>If the existing member of an etcd cluster restarts and retains an uncorrupted data directory after the restart, then it can simply re-join the cluster as an existing member without any API calls or configuration changes.
This is because the relevant metadata (including member ID and cluster ID) are <a href=https://etcd.io/docs/v2/admin_guide/#lifecycle>maintained in the write ahead logs</a>.
However, if it doesn&rsquo;t retain an uncorrupted data directory after the restart, then it must first be <a href=#removing-an-existing-member-from-an-etcd-cluster>removed</a> and <a href=#adding-a-new-member-to-an-etcd-cluster>added</a> as a new member.</p><h4 id=recovering-an-etcd-cluster-from-failure-of-majority-of-members>Recovering an etcd cluster from failure of majority of members</h4><p>If a majority of members of an etcd cluster fail but if they retain their uncorrupted data directory then they can be simply restarted and they will re-form the existing etcd cluster when they come up.
However, if they do not retain their uncorrupted data directory, then the etcd cluster must be <a href=https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/op-guide/recovery/#restoring-a-cluster>recovered from latest snapshot in the backup</a>.
This is very similar to <a href=#bootstrapping>bootstrapping</a> with the additional initial step of restoring the latest snapshot in each of the members.
However, the same <a href=#note>limitation</a> about incremental snapshots, as in the case of adding a new member, applies here.
But unlike in the case of <a href=#adding-a-new-member-to-an-etcd-cluster>adding a new member</a>, not applying incremental snapshots is not acceptable in the case of etcd cluster recovery.
Hence, if incremental snapshots are required to be applied, the etcd cluster must be <a href=https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/op-guide/runtime-configuration/#restart-cluster-from-majority-failure>recovered</a> in the following steps.</p><ol><li>Restore a new single-member cluster using the latest snapshot.</li><li>Apply incremental snapshots on the single-member cluster.</li><li>Take a full snapshot which can now be used while adding the remaining members.</li><li><a href=#adding-a-new-member-to-an-etcd-cluster>Add</a> new members using the latest snapshot created in the step above.</li></ol><h2 id=kubernetes-context>Kubernetes Context</h2><ul><li>Users will provision an etcd cluster in a Kubernetes cluster by creating an etcd CRD resource instance.</li><li>A multi-node etcd cluster is indicated if the <code>spec.replicas</code> field is set to any value greater than 1. The etcd-druid will add validation to ensure that the <code>spec.replicas</code> value is an odd number according to the requirements of etcd.</li><li>The etcd-druid controller will provision a statefulset with the etcd main container and the etcd-backup-restore sidecar container. It will pass on the <code>spec.replicas</code> field from the etcd resource to the statefulset. It will also supply the right pre-computed configuration to both the containers.</li><li>The statefulset controller will create the pods based on the pod template in the statefulset spec and these individual pods will be the members that form the etcd cluster.</li></ul><p><img src=/__resources/multinodeetcd_dfad24.png alt="Component diagram"></p><p>This approach makes it possible to satisfy the <a href=#assumption>assumption</a> that the DNS for the individual members of the etcd cluster must be known/computable.
This can be achieved by using a <code>headless</code> service (along with the statefulset) for each etcd cluster instance.
Then we can address individual pods/etcd members via the predictable DNS name of <code>&lt;statefulset_name>-{0|1|2|3|…|n}.&lt;headless_service_name></code> from within the Kubernetes namespace (or from outside the Kubernetes namespace by appending <code>.&lt;namespace>.svc.&lt;cluster_domain> suffix)</code>.
The etcd-druid controller can compute the above configurations automatically based on the <code>spec.replicas</code> in the etcd resource.</p><p>This proposal recommends this approach.</p><h4 id=alternative-1>Alternative</h4><p>One statefulset is used for each member (instead of one statefulset for all members).
While this approach gives a flexibility to have different pod specifications for the individual members, it makes managing the individual members (e.g. rolling updates) more complicated.
Hence, this approach is not recommended.</p><h2 id=etcd-configuration>ETCD Configuration</h2><p>As mentioned in the <a href=#general-approach-to-etcd-cluster-management>general approach section</a>, there are differences in the configuration that needs to be passed to individual members of an etcd cluster in different scenarios such as <a href=#bootstrapping>bootstrapping</a>, <a href=#adding-a-new-member-to-an-etcd-cluster>adding</a> a new member, <a href=#removing-an-existing-member-from-an-etcd-cluster>removing</a> a member, <a href=#restarting-an-existing-member-of-an-etcd-cluster>restarting</a> an existing member etc.
Managing such differences in configuration for individual pods of a statefulset is tricky in the <a href=#kubernetes-context>recommended approach</a> of using a single statefulset to manage all the member pods of an etcd cluster.
This is because statefulset uses the same pod template for all its pods.</p><p>The recommendation is for <code>etcd-druid</code> to provision the base configuration template in a <code>ConfigMap</code> which is passed to all the pods via the pod template in the <code>StatefulSet</code>.
The <code>initialization</code> flow of <code>etcd-backup-restore</code> (which is invoked every time the etcd container is (re)started) is then enhanced to generate the customized etcd configuration for the corresponding member pod (in a shared <em>volume</em> between etcd and the backup-restore containers) based on the supplied template configuration.
This will require that <code>etcd-backup-restore</code> will have to have a mechanism to detect which scenario listed <a href=#etcd-configuration>above</a> applies during any given member container/pod restart.</p><h3 id=alternative-2>Alternative</h3><p>As mentioned <a href=#alternative-1>above</a>, one statefulset is used for each member of the etcd cluster.
Then different configuration (generated directly by <code>etcd-druid</code>) can be passed in the pod templates of the different statefulsets.
Though this approach is advantageous in the context of managing the different configuration, it is not recommended in this proposal because it makes the rest of the management (e.g. rolling updates) more complicated.</p><h2 id=data-persistence>Data Persistence</h2><p>The type of persistence used to store etcd data (including the member ID and cluster ID) has an impact on the steps that are needed to be taken when the member pods or containers (<a href=#removing-an-existing-member-from-an-etcd-cluster>minority</a> of them or <a href=#restarting-an-existing-member-of-an-etcd-cluster>majority</a>) need to be recovered.</p><h3 id=persistent>Persistent</h3><p>Like the single-node case, <code>persistentvolumes</code> can be used to persist ETCD data for all the member pods. The individual member pods then get their own <code>persistentvolumes</code>.
The advantage is that individual members retain their member ID across pod restarts and even pod deletion/recreation across Kubernetes nodes.
This means that member pods that crash (or are unhealthy) can be <a href=#restarting-an-existing-member-of-an-etcd-cluster>restarted</a> automatically (by configuring <code>livenessProbe</code>) and they will re-join the etcd cluster using their existing member ID without any need for explicit etcd cluster management).</p><p>The disadvantages of this approach are as follows.</p><ul><li>The number of persistentvolumes increases linearly with the cluster size which is a cost-related concern.</li><li>Network-mounted persistentvolumes might eventually become a performance bottleneck under heavy load for a latency-sensitive component like ETCD.</li><li><a href=#single-node-etcd-cluster>Volume attach/detach issues</a> when associated with etcd cluster instances cause downtimes to the target shoot clusters that are backed by those etcd cluster instances.</li></ul><h3 id=ephemeral>Ephemeral</h3><p>The ephemeral volumes use-case is considered as an optimization and may be planned as a follow-up action.</p><h4 id=disk>Disk</h4><p>Ephemeral persistence can be achieved in Kubernetes by using either <a href=https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir><code>emptyDir</code></a> volumes or <a href=https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#local><code>local</code> persistentvolumes</a> to persist ETCD data.

But it has the disadvantage of tying down the member pod to a node which is a problem if the node becomes unhealthy requiring etcd druid to take additional actions (such as deleting the local persistent volume).</p><p>Based on these constraints, if ephemeral persistence is opted for, it is recommended to use <code>emptyDir</code> ephemeral persistence.</p><h4 id=in-memory>In-memory</h4><p>In-memory ephemeral persistence can be achieved in Kubernetes by using <code>emptyDir</code> with <a href=https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir><code>medium: Memory</code></a>.
In this case, a <code>tmpfs</code> (RAM-backed file-system) volume will be used.
In addition to the advantages of <a href=#ephemeral>ephemeral persistence</a>, this approach can achieve the fastest possible <em>disk I/O</em>.
Similarly, in addition to the disadvantages of <a href=#ephemeral>ephemeral persistence</a>, in-memory persistence has the following additional disadvantages.</p><ul><li>More memory required for the individual member pods.</li><li>Individual members may not at all retain their data and identity across container restarts let alone across pod restarts/deletion/recreation across Kubernetes nodes.
I.e. every time an etcd container restarts, <a href=#restarting-an-existing-member-of-an-etcd-cluster>the old member (represented by the container) will have to be removed and a new member has to be added</a>.</li></ul><h3 id=how-to-detect-if-valid-metadata-exists-in-an-etcd-member>How to detect if valid metadata exists in an etcd member</h3><p>Since the likelyhood of a member not having valid metadata in the WAL files is much more likely in the <a href=#ephemeral>ephemeral</a> persistence scenario, one option is to pass the information that ephemeral persistence is being used to the <code>etcd-backup-restore</code> sidecar (say, via command-line flags or environment variables).</p><p>But in principle, it might be better to determine this from the WAL files directly so that the possibility of corrupted WAL files also gets handled correctly.
To do this, the <a href=https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/main/server/storage/wal>wal</a> package has <a href=https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/57a092b45d0eae6c9e600e62513ffcd2f1f25a92/server/wal/wal.go#L324-L326>some</a> <a href=https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/57a092b45d0eae6c9e600e62513ffcd2f1f25a92/server/wal/wal.go#L429-L548>functions</a> that might be useful.</p><h4 id=recommendation>Recommendation</h4><p>It might be possible that using the <a href=https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/main/server/storage/wal>wal</a> package for verifying if valid metadata exists might be performance intensive.
So, the performance impact needs to be measured.
If the performance impact is acceptable (both in terms of resource usage and time), it is recommended to use this way to verify if the member contains valid metadata.
Otherwise, alternatives such as a simple check that WAL folder exists coupled with the static information about use of <a href=#persistent>persistent</a> or <a href=#ephemeral>ephemeral</a> storage might be considered.</p><h3 id=how-to-detect-if-valid-data-exists-in-an-etcd-member>How to detect if valid data exists in an etcd member</h3><p>The <a href=#decision-table-for-etcd-backup-restore-during-initialization>initialization sequence</a> in <code>etcd-backup-restore</code> already includes <a href=https://github.com/gardener/etcd-backup-restore/blob/c98f76c7c55f7d1039687cc293536d7caf893ba5/pkg/initializer/validator/datavalidator.go#L78-L94>database verification</a>.
This would suffice to determine if the member has valid data.</p><h3 id=recommendation-1>Recommendation</h3><p>Though <a href=#ephemeral>ephemeral</a> persistence has performance and logistics advantages,
it is recommended to start with <a href=#persistent>persistent</a> data for the member pods.
In addition to the reasons and concerns listed above, there is also the additional concern that in case of <a href=#backup-failure>backup failure</a>, the risk of additional data loss is a bit higher if ephemeral persistence is used (simultaneous quoram loss is sufficient) when compared to persistent storage (simultaenous quorum loss with majority persistence loss is needed).
The risk might still be acceptable but the idea is to gain experience about how frequently member containers/pods get restarted/recreated, how frequently leader election happens among members of an etcd cluster and how frequently etcd clusters lose quorum.
Based on this experience, we can move towards using <a href=#ephemeral>ephemeral</a> (perhaps even <a href=#in-memory>in-memory</a>) persistence for the member pods.</p><h2 id=separating-peer-and-client-traffic>Separating peer and client traffic</h2><p>The current single-node ETCD cluster implementation in <code>etcd-druid</code> and <code>etcd-backup-restore</code> uses a single <code>service</code> object to act as the entry point for the client traffic.
There is no separation or distinction between the client and peer traffic because there is not much benefit to be had by making that distinction.</p><p>In the multi-node ETCD cluster scenario, it makes sense to distinguish between and separate the peer and client traffic.
This can be done by using two <code>services</code>.</p><ul><li>peer<ul><li>To be used for peer communication. This could be a <code>headless</code> service.</li></ul></li><li>client<ul><li>To be used for client communication. This could be a normal <code>ClusterIP</code> service like it is in the single-node case.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The main advantage of this approach is that it makes it possible (if needed) to allow only peer to peer communication while blocking client communication. Such a thing might be required during some phases of some maintenance tasks (manual or automated).</p><h3 id=cutting-off-client-requests>Cutting off client requests</h3><p>At present, in the single-node ETCD instances, etcd-druid configures the readinessProbe of the etcd main container to probe the healthz endpoint of the etcd-backup-restore sidecar which considers the status of the latest backup upload in addition to the regular checks about etcd and the side car being up and healthy. This has the effect of setting the etcd main container (and hence the etcd pod) as not ready if the latest backup upload failed. This results in the endpoints controller removing the pod IP address from the endpoints list for the service which eventually cuts off ingress traffic coming into the etcd pod via the etcd client service. The rationale for this is to fail early when the backup upload fails rather than continuing to serve requests while the gap between the last backup and the current data increases which might lead to unacceptably large amount of data loss if disaster strikes.</p><p>This approach will not work in the multi-node scenario because we need the individual member pods to be able to talk to each other to maintain the cluster quorum when backup upload fails but need to cut off only client ingress traffic.</p><p>It is recommended to separate the backup health condition tracking taking appropriate remedial actions.
With that, the backup health condition tracking is now separated to the <a href=#conditions><code>BackupReady</code> condition</a> in the <a href=#status><code>Etcd</code> resource <code>status</code></a> and the cutting off of client traffic (which could now be done for more reasons than failed backups) can be achieved in a different way described <a href=#manipulating-client-service-podselector>below</a>.</p><h4 id=manipulating-client-service-podselector>Manipulating Client Service podSelector</h4><p>The client traffic can be cut off by updating (manually or automatically by some component) the <code>podSelector</code> of the client service to add an additional label (say, unhealthy or disabled) such that the <code>podSelector</code> no longer matches the member pods created by the statefulset.
This will result in the client ingress traffic being cut off.
The peer service is left unmodified so that peer communication is always possible.</p><h2 id=health-check>Health Check</h2><p>The etcd main container and the etcd-backup-restore sidecar containers will be configured with livenessProbe and readinessProbe which will indicate the health of the containers and effectively the corresponding ETCD cluster member pod.</p><h3 id=backup-failure>Backup Failure</h3><p>As described <a href=#cutting-off-client-requests>above</a> using <code>readinessProbe</code> failures based on latest backup failure is not viable in the multi-node ETCD scenario.</p><p>Though cutting off traffic by <a href=#manipulating-client-service-podselector>manipulating client <code>service</code> <code>podSelector</code></a> is workable, it may not be desirable.</p><p>It is recommended that on backup failure, the leading <code>etcd-backup-restore</code> sidecar (the one that is responsible for taking backups at that point in time, as explained in the <a href=#backup>backup section below</a>, updates the <a href=#conditions><code>BackupReady</code> condition</a> in the <a href=#status><code>Etcd</code> status</a> and raises a high priority alert to the landscape operators but <em><em>does not</em></em> cut off the client traffic.</p><p>The reasoning behind this decision to not cut off the client traffic on backup failure is to allow the Kubernetes cluster&rsquo;s control plane (which relies on the ETCD cluster) to keep functioning as long as possible and to avoid bringing down the control-plane due to a missed backup.</p><p>The risk of this approach is that with a cascaded sequence of failures (on top of the backup failure), there is a chance of more data loss than the frequency of backup would otherwise indicate.</p><p>To be precise, the risk of such an additional data loss manifests only when backup failure as well as a special case of quorum loss (majority of the members are not ready) happen in such a way that the ETCD cluster needs to be re-bootstrapped from the backup.
As described <a href=#recovering-an-etcd-cluster-from-failure-of-majority-of-members>here</a>, re-bootstrapping the ETCD cluster requires restoration from the latest backup only when a majority of members no longer have uncorrupted data persistence.</p><p>If <a href=#persistent>persistent storage</a> is used, this will happen only when backup failure as well as a majority of the disks/volumes backing the ETCD cluster members fail simultaneously.
This would indeed be rare and might be an acceptable risk.</p><p>If <a href=#ephemeral>ephemeral storage</a> is used (especially, <a href=#in-memory>in-memory</a>), the data loss will happen if a majority of the ETCD cluster members become <code>NotReady</code> (requiring a pod restart) at the same time as the backup failure.
This may not be as rare as majority members&rsquo; disk/volume failure.
The risk can be somewhat mitigated at least for planned maintenance operations by postponing potentially disruptive maintenance operations when <code>BackupReady</code> condition is <code>false</code> (vertical scaling, rolling updates, evictions due to node roll-outs).</p><p>But in practice (when <a href=#ephemeral>ephemeral storage</a> is used), the current proposal suggests restoring from the latest full backup even when a minority of ETCD members (even a single pod) <a href=#restarting-an-existing-member-of-an-etcd-cluster>restart</a> both to speed up the process of the new member catching up to the latest revision but also to avoid load on the leading member which needs to supply the data to bring the new member up-to-date.
But as described <a href=#adding-a-new-member-to-an-etcd-cluster>here</a>, in case of a minority member failure while using ephemeral storage, it is possible to restart the new member with empty data and let it fetch all the data from the leading member (only if backup is not accessible).
Though this is suboptimal, it is workable given the constraints and conditions.
With this, the risk of additional data loss in the case of ephemeral storage is only if backup failure as well as quorum loss happens.
While this is still less rare than the risk of additional data loss in case of persistent storage, the risk might be tolerable. Provided the risk of quorum loss is not too high. This needs to be monitored/evaluated before opting for ephemeral storage.</p><p>Given these constraints, it is better to dynamically avoid/postpone some potentially disruptive operations when <code>BackupReady</code> condition is <code>false</code>.
This has the effect of allowing <code>n/2</code> members to be evicted when the backups are healthy and completely disabling evictions when backups are not healthy.</p><ol><li>Skip/postpone potentially disruptive maintenance operations (listed below) when the <code>BackupReady</code> condition is <code>false</code>.</li><li>Vertical scaling.</li><li>Rolling updates, Basically, any updates to the <code>StatefulSet</code> spec which includes vertical scaling.</li><li>Dynamically toggle the <code>minAvailable</code> field of the <a href=#poddisruptionbudget><code>PodDisruptionBudget</code></a> between <code>n/2 + 1</code> and <code>n</code> (where <code>n</code> is the ETCD desired cluster size) whenever the <code>BackupReady</code> condition toggles between <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</li></ol><p>This will mean that <code>etcd-backup-restore</code> becomes Kubernetes-aware. But there might be reasons for making <code>etcd-backup-restore</code> Kubernetes-aware anyway (e.g. to update the <code>etcd</code> resource <a href=#status>status</a> with latest full snapshot details).
This enhancement should keep <code>etcd-backup-restore</code> backward compatible.
I.e. it should be possible to use <code>etcd-backup-restore</code> Kubernetes-unaware as before this proposal.
This is possible either by auto-detecting the existence of kubeconfig or by an explicit command-line flag (such as <code>--enable-client-service-updates</code> which can be defaulted to <code>false</code> for backward compatibility).</p><h5 id=alternative-3>Alternative</h5><p>The alternative is for <code>etcd-druid</code> to implement the <a href=#manipulating-client-service-podselector>above functionality</a>.</p><p>But <code>etcd-druid</code> is centrally deployed in the host Kubernetes cluster and cannot scale well horizontally.
So, it can potentially be a bottleneck if it is involved in regular health check mechanism for all the etcd clusters it manages.
Also, the recommended approach above is more robust because it can work even if <code>etcd-druid</code> is down when the backup upload of a particular etcd cluster fails.</p><h2 id=status>Status</h2><p>It is desirable (for the <code>etcd-druid</code> and landscape administrators/operators) to maintain/expose status of the etcd cluster instances in the <code>status</code> sub-resource of the <code>Etcd</code> CRD.

The <code>member</code> entry would be marked as <code>NotReady</code> if the corresponding <code>pod</code> is not ready (with reason <code>PodNotReady</code>) or as <code>Unknown</code> if the corresponding <code>lease</code> has expired (with <code>reason: LeaseExpired</code>).</p><p>While renewing the lease, the <code>etcd-backup-restore</code> sidecars also maintain the ETCD member <code>id</code> and their <code>role</code> (<code>Leader</code> or <code>Member</code>) separated by <code>:</code> in the <code>spec.holderIdentity</code> field of the corresponding <code>lease</code> object since this information is only available to the <code>ETCD</code> member processes and the <code>etcd-backup-restore</code> sidecars (e.g. <code>272e204152:Leader</code> or <code>272e204153:Member</code>).
When the <code>lease</code> objects are created by <code>etcd-druid</code>, the <code>spec.holderIdentity</code> field would be empty.</p><p>The value in <code>spec.holderIdentity</code> in the <code>leases</code> is parsed and copied onto the <code>id</code> and <code>role</code> fields of the corresponding <code>status.members</code> by <code>etcd-druid</code>.</p><h3 id=conditions>Conditions</h3><p>The <code>conditions</code> section in the status describe the overall condition of the ETCD cluster.
The condition type <code>Ready</code> indicates if the ETCD cluster as a whole is ready to serve requests (i.e. the cluster is quorate) even though some minority of the members are not ready.
The condition type <code>AllMembersReady</code> indicates of all the members of the ETCD cluster are ready.
The distinction between these conditions could be significant for both external consumers of the status as well as <code>etcd-druid</code> itself.
Some maintenance operations might be safe to do (e.g. rolling updates) only when all members of the cluster are ready.
The condition type <code>BackupReady</code> indicates of the most recent backup upload (full or incremental) succeeded.
This information also might be significant because some maintenance operations might be safe to do (e.g. anything that involves re-bootstrapping the ETCD cluster) only when backup is ready.</p><p>The <code>Ready</code> and <code>AllMembersReady</code> conditions can be maintained by <code>etcd-druid</code> based on the status in the <a href=#members><code>members</code> section</a>.
The <code>BackupReady</code> condition will be maintained by the leading <code>etcd-backup-restore</code> sidecar that is in charge of taking backups.</p><p>More condition types could be introduced in the future if specific purposes arise.</p><h3 id=clustersize>ClusterSize</h3><p>The <code>clusterSize</code> field contains the current size of the ETCD cluster. It will be actively kept up-to-date by <code>etcd-druid</code> in all scenarios.</p><ul><li>Before <a href=#bootstrapping>bootstrapping</a> the ETCD cluster (during cluster creation or later bootstrapping because of <a href=#recommended-action-9>quorum failure</a>), <code>etcd-druid</code> will clear the <code>status.members</code> array and set <code>status.clusterSize</code> to be equal to <code>spec.replicas</code>.</li><li>While the ETCD cluster is quorate, <code>etcd-druid</code> will actively set <code>status.clusterSize</code> to be equal to length of the <code>status.members</code> whenever the length of the array changes (say, due to scaling of the ETCD cluster).</li></ul><p>Given that <code>clusterSize</code> reliably represents the size of the ETCD cluster, it can be used to calculate the <code>Ready</code> <a href=#conditions>condition</a>.</p><h3 id=alternative-4>Alternative</h3><p>The alternative is for <code>etcd-druid</code> to maintain the status in the <code>Etcd</code> status sub-resource.
But <code>etcd-druid</code> is centrally deployed in the host Kubernetes cluster and cannot scale well horizontally.
So, it can potentially be a bottleneck if it is involved in regular health check mechanism for all the etcd clusters it manages.
Also, the recommended approach above is more robust because it can work even if <code>etcd-druid</code> is down when the backup upload of a particular etcd cluster fails.</p><h2 id=decision-table-for-etcd-druid-based-on-the-status>Decision table for etcd-druid based on the status</h2><p>The following decision table describes the various criteria <code>etcd-druid</code> takes into consideration to determine the different etcd cluster management scenarios and the corresponding reconciliation actions it must take.
The general principle is to detect the scenario and take the minimum action to move the cluster along the path to good health.
The path from any one scenario to a state of good health will typically involve going through multiple reconciliation actions which probably take the cluster through many other cluster management scenarios.
Especially, it is proposed that individual members auto-heal where possible, even in the case of the failure of a majority of members of the etcd cluster and that <code>etcd-druid</code> takes action only if the auto-healing doesn&rsquo;t happen for a configured period of time.</p><h3 id=1-pink-of-health>1.

The leading member should be defragmented last after all the rest of the members have been defragmented to minimise potential leadership changes caused by defragmentation.

This is to disable eviction of any member pods when not all members are <code>Ready</code>.</p><p>In case of a conflict, the recommendation is to use the highest of the applicable values for <code>minAvailable</code>.</p><h2 id=rolling-updates-to-etcd-members>Rolling updates to etcd members</h2><p>Any changes to the <code>Etcd</code> resource spec that might result in a change to <code>StatefulSet</code> spec or otherwise result in a rolling update of member pods should be applied/propagated by <code>etcd-druid</code> only when the etcd cluster is fully healthy to reduce the risk of quorum loss during the updates.
This would include vertical autoscaling changes (via, <a href=https://github.com/gardener/hvpa-controller>HVPA</a>).
If the cluster <a href=#status>status</a> unhealthy (i.e. if either <code>AllMembersReady</code> or <code>BackupReady</code> <a href=#conditions>conditions</a> are <code>false</code>), <code>etcd-druid</code> must restore it to full health <a href=#backup-failure>before proceeding</a> with such operations that lead to rolling updates.

This cannot be achieved by etcd-druid alone which has only the view of a single Kubernetes cluster.
An additional component that has the view of all the Kubernetes clusters involved in setting up the gardener ring will be required to achieve this.
However, etcd-druid can be used by such a higher-level component/controller (for example, by supplying the initial cluster configuration) such that individual etcd-druid instances in the individual Kubernetes clusters can manage the corresponding etcd cluster members.</p><h3 id=autonomous-shoot-clusters>Autonomous Shoot Clusters</h3><p><a href=https://github.com/gardener/gardener/issues/2906>Autonomous Shoot Clusters</a> also will require a highly availble etcd cluster to back its control-plane and the multi-node support proposed here can be leveraged in that context.
However, the current proposal will not meet all the needs of a autonomous shoot cluster.
Some additional components will be required that have the overall view of the autonomous shoot cluster and they can use etcd-druid to manage the multi-node etcd cluster. But this scenario may be different from that of <a href=#gardener-ring>Gardener Ring</a> in that the individual etcd members of the cluster may not be hosted on different Kubernetes clusters.</p><h3 id=optimization-of-recovery-from-non-quorate-cluster-with-some-member-containing-valid-data>Optimization of recovery from non-quorate cluster with some member containing valid data</h3><p>It might be possible to optimize the actions during the recovery of a non-quorate cluster where some of the members contain valid data and some other don&rsquo;t.
The optimization involves verifying the data of the valid members to determine the data of which member is the most recent (even considering the latest backup) so that the <a href=#recovering-an-etcd-cluster-from-failure-of-majority-of-members>full snapshot</a> can be taken from it before recovering the etcd cluster.
Such an optimization can be attempted in the future.</p><h3 id=optimization-of-rolling-updates-to-unhealthy-etcd-clusters>Optimization of rolling updates to unhealthy etcd clusters</h3><p>As mentioned <a href=#rolling-updates-to-etcd-members>above</a>, optimizations to proceed with rolling updates to unhealthy etcd clusters (without first restoring the cluster to full health) can be pursued in future work.</p></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer row d-print-none"><div class="container-fluid footer-wrapper"><ul class=nav><li><a href=https://gardener.cloud/blog/>Blogs</a></li><li><a href=https://gardener.cloud/community/>Community</a></li><li><a href=https://gardener.cloud/adopter/>Adopters</a></li><li><a href=/docs/>Documentation</a></li></ul><img src=/images/lp/gardener-logo.svg alt="Logo Gardener" class=logo><ul class=media-wr><li><a target=_blank href=https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CB57N0BFG><img src=/images/branding/slack-logo-white.svg class=media-icon><div class=media-text>Slack</div></a></li><li><a target=_blank href=https://github.com/gardener><img src=/images/branding/github-mark-logo.png class=media-icon><div class=media-text>GitHub</div></a></li><li><a target=_blank href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwUhwKFREV8Su0gwAJQX7tw><img src=/images/branding/youtube-logo-dark.svg class=media-icon><div class=media-text>YouTube</div></a></li><li><a target=_blank href=https://twitter.com/GardenerProject><img src=/images/branding/twitter-logo-white.svg class=media-icon><div class=media-text>Twitter</div></a></li></ul><span class=copyright>Copyright 2019-2023 Gardener project authors. <a href=https://www.sap.com/corporate/en/legal/privacy.html>Privacy policy
