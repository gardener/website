Multiple DNSProvider can be used simultaneously and changed without restarting the DNS controller.\nDNS records are either created directly for a corresponding custom resource DNSEntry or by annotating a service or ingress.\nFor a detailed explanation of the model, see section The Model.\nFor extending or adapting this project with your own source or provisioning controllers, see section Extensions\nQuick start To install the DNS controller manager in your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps.\n  Prerequisites\n  Check out or download the project to get a copy of the Helm charts. It is recommended to check out the tag of the last release, so that Helm values reference the newest released container image for the deployment.\n  Make sure, that you have installed Helm client (helm) locally and Helm server (tiller) on the Kubernetes cluster. See e.g. Helm installation for more details.\n    Install the DNS controller manager\nAs multiple Gardener DNS controllers can act on the same DNS Hosted Zone concurrently, each instance needs an owner identifier. Therefore choose an identifier sufficiently unique across these instances.\nThen install the DNS controller manager with\nhelm install charts/external-dns-management --name dns-controller --namespace=\u0026lt;my-namespace\u0026gt; --set configuration.identifier=\u0026lt;my-identifier\u0026gt; This will use the default configuration with all source and provisioning controllers enabled. The complete set of configuration variables can be found in charts/external-dns-management/values.yaml. Their meaning is explained by their corresponding command line options in section Using the DNS controller manager\nBy default, the DNS controller looks for custom resources in all namespaces. The choosen namespace is only relevant for the deployment itself.\n  Create a DNSProvider\nTo specify a DNS provider, you need to create a custom resource DNSProvider and a secret containing the credentials for your account at the provider. E.g. if you want to use AWS Route53, create a secret and provider with\ncat \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: aws-credentials namespace: default type: Opaque data: # replace \u0026#39;...\u0026#39; with values encoded as base64 # see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ... AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ... EOF and\ncat \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: dns.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1 kind: DNSProvider metadata: name: aws namespace: default spec: type: aws-route53 secretRef: name: aws-credentials domains: include: # this must be replaced with a (sub)domain of the hosted zone - my.own.domain.com EOF Check the successful creation with\nkubectl get dnspr You should see something like\nNAME TYPE STATUS AGE aws aws-route53 Ready 12s   Create a DNSEntry\nCreate an DNS entry with\ncat \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: dns.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1 kind: DNSEntry metadata: name: mydnsentry namespace: default spec: dnsName: \u0026#34;myentry.my-own-domain.com\u0026#34; ttl: 600 targets: - 1.2.3.4 EOF Check the status of the DNS entry with\nkubectl get dnsentry You should see something like\nNAME DNS TYPE PROVIDER STATUS AGE mydnsentry myentry.my-own-domain.com aws-route53 default/aws Ready 24s As soon as the status of the entry is Ready, the provider has accepted the new DNS record. Depending on the provider and your DNS settings and cache, it may take up to a few minutes before the domain name can be resolved.\n  Wait for/check DNS record\nTo check the DNS resolution, use nslookup or dig.\nnslookup myentry.my-own-domain.com or with dig\n# or with dig dig +short myentry.my-own-domain.com Depending on your network settings, you may get a successful response faster using a public DNS server (e.g. 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4, or 1.1.1.1)\ndig @8.8.8.8 +short myentry.my-own-domain.com   For more examples about the custom resources and the annotations for services and ingresses see the examples directory.\nAutomatic creation of DNS entries for services and ingresses Using the source controllers, it is also possible to create DNS entries for services (of type LoadBalancer) and ingresses automatically. The resources only need to be annotated with some special values. In this case ensure that the source controllers are enabled on startup of the DNS controller manager, i.e. the value of the command line option --controllers must contain dnscontrollers or equal to all. The DNS source controllers watch resources on the default cluster and create DNS entries on the target cluster. As there can be multiple controllers active on the same cluster, you may need to set the correct DNSClass both for the controller and for the source resource by setting the annotation dns.gardener.cloud/class. The default value for the DNSClass is gardendns.\nNote that if you delegate the DNS management for shoot resources to Gardener via the shoot-dns-service extension, the correct annotation is dns.gardener.cloud/class=garden.\nHere is an example for annotating a service (same as examples/50-service-with-dns.yaml)]:\napiVersion:v1kind:Servicemetadata:annotations:dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames:echo.my-dns-domain.comdns.gardener.cloud/ttl:\u0026#34;500\u0026#34;# If you are delegating the DNS Management to Gardener, uncomment the following line (see https://gardener.cloud/documentation/guides/administer_shoots/dns_names/)#`dns.gardener.cloud/class`: gardenname:test-servicenamespace:defaultspec:ports:- name:httpport:80protocol:TCPtargetPort:8080sessionAffinity:Nonetype:LoadBalancerThe Model This project provides a flexible model allowing to add DNS source objects and DNS provisioning environments by adding new independent controllers.\nThere is no single DNS controller anymore. The decoupling between the handling of DNS source objects, like ingresses or services, and the provisioning of DNS entries in an external DNS provider like Route53 or CloudDNS is achieved by introducing a new custom resource DNSEntry.\nThese objects can either be explicitly created to request dedicated DNS entries, or they are managed based on other resources like ingresses or services. For the latter dedicated DNS Source Controllers are used. There might be any number of such source controllers. They do not need to know anything about the various DNS environments. Their task is to figure out which DNS entries are required in their realm and manage appropriate DNSEntry objects. From these objects they can also read the provisioning status and report it back to the original source.\nProvisioning of DNS entries in external DNS providers is done by DNS Provisioning Controllers. They don\u0026rsquo;t need to know anything about the various DNS source objects. They watch DNSEntry objects and check whether they are responsible for such an object. If a provisioning controller feels responsible for an entry it manages the corresponding settings in the external DNS environment and reports the provisioning status back to the corresponding DNSEntry object.\nTo do this a provisioning controller is responsible for a dedicated environment (for example Route53). For every such environment the controller uses a dedicated type key. This key is used to look for DNSProvider objects. There might be multiple such objects per environment, specifying the credentials needed to access different external accounts. These accounts are then scanned for DNS zones and domain names they support. This information is then used to dynamically assign DNSEntry objects to dedicated DNSProvider objects. If such an assignment can be done by a provisioning controller then it is responsible for this entry and manages the corresponding entries in the external environment. DNSProvider objects can specify explicit inclusion and exclusion sets of domain names and/or DNS zone identifiers to override the scanning results of the account.\nOwner Identifiers Every DNS Provisioning Controller is responsible for a set of Owner Identifiers. DNS records in an external DNS environment are attached to such an identifier. This is used to identify the records in the DNS environment managed by a dedicated controller (manager). Every controller manager hosting DNS Provisioning Controllers offers an option to specify a default identifier. Additionally there might be dedicated DNSOwner objects that enable or disable additional owner ids.\nEvery DNSEntry object may specify a dedicated owner that is used to tag the records in the DNS environment. A DNS provisioning controller only acts of DNS entries it is responsible for. Other resources in the external DNS environment are not touched at all.\nThis way it is possbible to\n identify records in the external DNS management environment that are managed by the actual controller instance distinguish different DNS source environments sharing the same hosted zones in the external management environment cleanup unused entries, even if the whole resource set is already gone move the responsibility for dedicated sets of DNS entries among different kubernetes clusters or DNS source environments running different DNS Provisioning Controller without loosing the entries during the migration process.  If multiple DNS controller instances have access to the same DNS zones, it is very important, that every instance uses a unique owner identifier! Otherwise the cleanup of stale DNS record will delete entries created by another instance if they use the same identifier.\nDNS Classes Multiple sets of controllers of the DNS ecosystem can run in parallel in a kubernetes cluster working on different object set. They are separated by using different DNS Classes. Adding a DNS class annotation to an object of the DNS ecosytems assigns this object to such a dedicated set of DNS controllers. This way it is possible to maintain clearly separated set of DNS objects in a single kubernetes cluster.\nDNSAnnotation objects DNS source controllers support the creation of DNS entries for potentiialy any kind of resource originally not equipped to describe the generation of DNS entries. This is done by additionally annotations. Nevertheless it might be the case, that those objects are again the result of a generation process, ether by predefined helm starts or by other higher level controllers. It is not necessarily possible to influence those generation steps to additionally generate the deired DNS annotations.\nThe typical mechanis in Kubernetes to handle this is to provide mutating webhooks that enrich the generated objects accordingly. But this mechanism is basically not intended to support dedicated settings for dedicated instances. At least it is very strenous to provide web hooks for every such usecase.\nTherefore the DNS ecosystem provided by this project supports an additional extension mechanism to annotate any kind of object with additional annotations by supported a dedicated resource, the DNSAnnotation.\nThe handling of this resource is done by a dedicated controller, the annotation controller. It caches the annotation settings declared by those objects and makes them accessible for the DNS source controllers.\nThe DNS source controller responsible for a dedicated kind of resource (for example Service reads the object analyses the annotations and then decides what to do with it. Most of the flow is handled by a central library, only some dedicated resource dependent steps are implemented separately by a dedicated source controller. The DNSAnnotationresource slightly extends this flow: After reading the object the library additionally checks for the existence of a DNSAnnotation setting for this object by querying the annotation controller\u0026rsquo;s cache. If found, it adds annotations declared there to the original object prior to the next processing steps. This way, for example whenver a Service without any DNS related annotation is handled by the controller and it finds a matching DNSAnnotation setting, the set of actual annotations is enriched accordingly before the actual processing of the service object is done by the controller.\nThis DNSAnnotation object can be created before or even after the object to be annotated and will implicity cause a reprocessing of the original object by its DNS source controller.\nFor example, the following object enforces a DNS related annotation for the processing of the service object testapp/default by the service DNS source controller:\napiVersion:dns.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:DNSAnnotationmetadata:name:testappspec:resourceRef:kind:ServiceapiVersion:v1name:testappannotations:dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames:testapp.dns.gardener.clouddns.gardener.cloud/ttl:\u0026#34;500\u0026#34;Using the DNS controller manager The controllers to run can be selected with the --controllers option. Here the following controller groups can be used:\n  dnssources: all DNS Source Controllers. It includes the conrollers\n ingress-dns: handle DNS annotations for the standard kubernetes ingress resource service-dns: handle DNS annotations for the standard kubernetes service resource    dnscontrollers: all DNS Provisioning Controllers. It includes the controllers\n alicloud-dns: aws-route53: azure-dns: google-clouddns: openstack-designate: cloudflare-dns    all: (default) all controllers\n  It is also possible to list dedicated controllers by their name.\nIf a DNS Provisioning Controller is enabled it is important to specify a unique controller identity using the --identifier option. This identifier is stored in the DNS system to identify the DNS entries managed by a dedicated controller. There should never be two DNS controllers with the same identifier running at the same time for the same DNS domains/accounts.\nHere is the complete list of options provided:\nUsage:

Defines how long the record is kept in cache by DNS servers or resolvers. --version version for dns-controller-manager Extensions This project can also be used as library to implement own source and provisioning controllers.\nHow to implement Source Controllers Based on the provided source controller library a source controller must implement the source.DNSSource interface and provide an appropriate creator function.\nA source controller can be implemented following this example:\npackage service import ( \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/controller-manager-library/pkg/resources\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/dns/source\u0026#34; ) var _MAIN_RESOURCE = resources.NewGroupKind(\u0026#34;core\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Service\u0026#34;) func init() { source.DNSSourceController(source.NewDNSSouceTypeForExtractor(\u0026#34;service-dns\u0026#34;, _MAIN_RESOURCE, GetTargets),nil). FinalizerDomain(\u0026#34;dns.gardener.cloud\u0026#34;). MustRegister(source.CONTROLLER_GROUP_DNS_SOURCES) } Complete examples can be found in the sub packages of pkg/controller/source.\nHow to implement Provisioning Controllers Provisioning controllers can be implemented based on the provisioning controller library in this repository and must implement the provider.DNSHandlerFactory interface. This factory returns implementations of the provider.DNSHandler interface that does the effective work for a dedicated set of hosted zones.\nThese factories can be embedded into a final controller manager (the runnable instance) in several ways:\n The factory can be used to create a dedicated controller. This controller can then be embedded into a controller manager, either in its own controller manger or together with other controllers. The factory can be added to a compound factory, able to handle multiple infrastructures. This one can then be used to create a dedicated controller, again.  Embedding a Factory into a Controller A provisioning controller can be implemented following this example:\npackage controller import ( \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/dns/provider\u0026#34; ) const CONTROLLER_NAME = \u0026#34;route53-dns-controller\u0026#34; func init() { provider.DNSController(CONTROLLER_NAME, \u0026amp;Factory{}). FinalizerDomain(\u0026#34;dns.gardener.cloud\u0026#34;). MustRegister(provider.CONTROLLER_GROUP_DNS_CONTROLLERS) } This controller can be embedded into a controller manager just by using an anonymous import of the controller package in the main package of a dedicated controller manager.\nComplete examples are available in the sub packages of pkg/controller/provider. They also show a typical set of implementation structures that help to structure the implementation of such controllers.\nThe provider implemented in this project always follow the same structure:\n the provider package contains the provider code the factory source file registers the factory at a default compound factory it contains a sub package controller, which contains the embedding of the factory into a dedicated controller  Embedding a Factory into a Compound Factory A provisioning controller based on a Compound Factory can be extended by a new provider factory by registering this factory at the compound factory. This could be done, for example, by using the default compound factory provided in package pkg/controller/provider/compound as shown here, where NewHandler is a function creating a dedicated handler for a dedicated provider type:\npackage aws import ( \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/compound\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/dns/provider\u0026#34; ) const TYPE_CODE = \u0026#34;aws-route53\u0026#34; var Factory = provider.NewDNSHandlerFactory(TYPE_CODE, NewHandler) func init() { compound.MustRegister(Factory) } The compound factory is then again embedded into a provisioning controller as shown in the previous section (see the controllersub package).\nSetting Up a Controller Manager One or multiple controller packages can be bundled into a controller manager, by implementing a main package like this:\npackage main import ( \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/controller-manager-library/pkg/controllermanager\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/\u0026lt;your controller package\u0026gt;\u0026#34; ... ) func main() { controllermanager.Start(\u0026#34;my-dns-controller-manager\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dns controller manager\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;some description\u0026#34;) } Using the standard Compound Provisioning Controller If the standard Compound Provisioning Controller should be used it is required to additionally add the anonymous imports for the providers intended to be embedded into the compound factory like this:\n Example Coding package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;os\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/controller-manager-library/pkg/controllermanager\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/compound/controller\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/\u0026lt;your provider\u0026gt;\u0026#34; ... ) func main() { controllermanager.Start(\u0026#34;dns-controller-manager\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dns controller manager\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nothing\u0026#34;) }  Multiple Cluster Support The controller implementations provided in this project are prepared to work with multiple clusters by using the features of the used controller manager library.\nThe DNS Source Controllers support two clusters:\n the default cluster is used to scan for source objects the logical cluster target is used to maintain the DNSEnry objects.  The DNS Provisioning Controllers also support two clusters:\n the default cluster is used to scan for DNSEntry objects. It is mapped to the logical cluster target the logical cluster provider is used to look to the DNSProvider objects and their related secrets.  If those controller types should be combined in a single controller manager, it can be configured to support three potential clusters with the source objects, the one for the entry objects and the one with provider objects using cluster mappings.\nThis is shown in a complete example using the dns source controllers, the compound provisioning controller configured to support all the included DNS provider type factories:\n Example Coding package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;os\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/controller-manager-library/pkg/controllermanager\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/controller-manager-library/pkg/controllermanager/cluster\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/controller-manager-library/pkg/controllermanager/controller\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/controller-manager-library/pkg/controllermanager/controller/mappings\u0026#34; dnsprovider \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/dns/provider\u0026#34; dnssource \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/dns/source\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/compound/controller\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/alicloud\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/aws\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/azure\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/google\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/openstack\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/cloudflare\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/source/ingress\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/source/service\u0026#34; ) func init() { // target cluster already defined in dns source controller package  cluster.Configure( dnsprovider.PROVIDER_CLUSTER, \u0026#34;providers\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cluster to look for provider objects\u0026#34;, ).Fallback(dnssource.TARGET_CLUSTER) mappings.ForControllerGroup(dnsprovider.CONTROLLER_GROUP_DNS_CONTROLLERS). Map(controller.CLUSTER_MAIN, dnssource.TARGET_CLUSTER).MustRegister() } func main() { controllermanager.Start(\u0026#34;dns-controller-manager\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dns controller manager\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nothing\u0026#34;) }  Those clusters can the be separated by registering their names together with command line option names. These can be used to specify different kubeconfig files for those clusters.\nBy default all logical clusters are mapped to the default physical cluster specified via --kubeconfig or default cluster access.\nIf multiple physical clusters are defined they can be specified by a corresponding cluster option defining the kubeconfig file used to access this cluster. If no such option is specified the default is used.\nTherefore, even if the configuration is prepared for multiple clusters, such a controller manager can easily work on a single cluster if no special options are given on the command line.\nWhy not using the community external-dns solution? Some of the reasons are context-specific, i.e. relate to Gardener\u0026rsquo;s highly dynamic requirements.\n Custom resource for DNS entries  DNS entries are explicitly specified as custom resources. As an important side effect, each DNS entry provides an own status. Simply by querying the Kubernetes API, a client can check if a requested DNS entry has been successfully added to the DNS backend, or if an update has already been deployed, or if not to reason about the cause. It also opens for easy extensibility, as DNS entries can be created directly via the Kubernetes API. And it simplifies Day 2 operations, e.g. automatic cleanup of unused entries if a DNS provider is deleted.\nManagement of multiple DNS providers  The Gardener DNS controller uses a custom resource DNSProvider to dynamically manage the backend DNS services. While with external-dns you have to specify the single provider during startup, in the Gardener DNS controller you can add/update/delete providers during runtime with different credentials and/or backends. This is important for a multi-tenant environment as in Gardener, where users can bring their own accounts.\nA DNS provider can also restrict its actions on subset of the DNS domains (includes and excludes) for which the credentials are capable to edit.\nEach provider can define a separate “owner” identifier, to differentiate DNS entries in the same DNS zone from different providers.\nMulti cluster support  The Gardener DNS controller distinguish three different logical Kubernetes clusters: Source cluster, target cluster and runtime cluster. The source cluster is monitored by the DNS source controllers for annotations on ingress and service resources. These controllers then create DNS entries in the target cluster. DNS entries in the target cluster are then reconciliated/synchronized with the corresponding DNS backend service by the provider controller. The runtime cluster is the cluster the DNS controller runs on. For example, this enables needed flexibility in the Gardener deployment. The DNS controller runs on the seed cluster. This is also the target cluster. DNS providers and entries resources are created in the corresponding namespace of the shoot control plane, while the source cluster is the shoot cluster itself.\nOptimizations for handling hundreds of DNS entries  Some DNS backend services are restricted on the API calls per second (e.g. the AWS Route 53 API). To manage hundreds of DNS entries it is important to minimize the number of API calls. The Gardener DNS controller heavily makes usage of caches and batch processing for this reason.\n"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/v1.12.8/concepts/networking/dns-managment/","title":"DNS Management","tags":[],"description":"","content":"External DNS Management The main artefact of this project is the DNS controller manager for managing DNS records, also nicknamed as the Gardener \u0026ldquo;DNS Controller\u0026rdquo;.\nIt contains provisioning controllers for creating DNS records in one of the DNS cloud services\n Amazon Route53, Google CloudDNS, AliCloud DNS, Azure DNS, OpenStack Designate, Cloudflare DNS, Infoblox,  and source controllers for services and ingresses to create DNS entries by annotations.\nThe configuration for the external DNS service is specified in a custom resource DNSProvider. Multiple DNSProvider can be used simultaneously and changed without restarting the DNS controller.\nDNS records are either created directly for a corresponding custom resource DNSEntry or by annotating a service or ingress.\nFor a detailed explanation of the model, see section The Model.\nFor extending or adapting this project with your own source or provisioning controllers, see section Extensions\nQuick start To install the DNS controller manager in your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps.\n  Prerequisites\n  Check out or download the project to get a copy of the Helm charts. It is recommended to check out the tag of the last release, so that Helm values reference the newest released container image for the deployment.\n  Make sure, that you have installed Helm client (helm) locally and Helm server (tiller) on the Kubernetes cluster. See e.g. Helm installation for more details.\n    Install the DNS controller manager\nAs multiple Gardener DNS controllers can act on the same DNS Hosted Zone concurrently, each instance needs an owner identifier. Therefore choose an identifier sufficiently unique across these instances.\nThen install the DNS controller manager with\nhelm install charts/external-dns-management --name dns-controller --namespace=\u0026lt;my-namespace\u0026gt; --set configuration.identifier=\u0026lt;my-identifier\u0026gt; This will use the default configuration with all source and provisioning controllers enabled. The complete set of configuration variables can be found in charts/external-dns-management/values.yaml. Their meaning is explained by their corresponding command line options in section Using the DNS controller manager\nBy default, the DNS controller looks for custom resources in all namespaces. The choosen namespace is only relevant for the deployment itself.\n  Create a DNSProvider\nTo specify a DNS provider, you need to create a custom resource DNSProvider and a secret containing the credentials for your account at the provider. E.g. if you want to use AWS Route53, create a secret and provider with\ncat \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: aws-credentials namespace: default type: Opaque data: # replace \u0026#39;...\u0026#39; with values encoded as base64 # see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ... AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ...

Depending on the provider and your DNS settings and cache, it may take up to a few minutes before the domain name can be resolved.\n  Wait for/check DNS record\nTo check the DNS resolution, use nslookup or dig.\nnslookup myentry.my-own-domain.com or with dig\n# or with dig dig +short myentry.my-own-domain.com Depending on your network settings, you may get a successful response faster using a public DNS server (e.g. 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4, or 1.1.1.1)\ndig @8.8.8.8 +short myentry.my-own-domain.com   For more examples about the custom resources and the annotations for services and ingresses see the examples directory.\nAutomatic creation of DNS entries for services and ingresses Using the source controllers, it is also possible to create DNS entries for services (of type LoadBalancer) and ingresses automatically. The resources only need to be annotated with some special values. In this case ensure that the source controllers are enabled on startup of the DNS controller manager, i.e. the value of the command line option --controllers must contain dnscontrollers or equal to all. The DNS source controllers watch resources on the default cluster and create DNS entries on the target cluster. As there can be multiple controllers active on the same cluster, you may need to set the correct DNSClass both for the controller and for the source resource by setting the annotation dns.gardener.cloud/class. The default value for the DNSClass is gardendns.\nNote that if you delegate the DNS management for shoot resources to Gardener via the shoot-dns-service extension, the correct annotation is dns.gardener.cloud/class=garden.\nHere is an example for annotating a service (same as examples/50-service-with-dns.yaml)]:\napiVersion:v1kind:Servicemetadata:annotations:dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames:echo.my-dns-domain.comdns.gardener.cloud/ttl:\u0026#34;500\u0026#34;# If you are delegating the DNS Management to Gardener, uncomment the following line (see https://gardener.cloud/documentation/guides/administer_shoots/dns_names/)#`dns.gardener.cloud/class`: gardenname:test-servicenamespace:defaultspec:ports:- name:httpport:80protocol:TCPtargetPort:8080sessionAffinity:Nonetype:LoadBalancerThe Model This project provides a flexible model allowing to add DNS source objects and DNS provisioning environments by adding new independent controllers.\nThere is no single DNS controller anymore. The decoupling between the handling of DNS source objects, like ingresses or services, and the provisioning of DNS entries in an external DNS provider like Route53 or CloudDNS is achieved by introducing a new custom resource DNSEntry.\nThese objects can either be explicitly created to request dedicated DNS entries, or they are managed based on other resources like ingresses or services. For the latter dedicated DNS Source Controllers are used. There might be any number of such source controllers. They do not need to know anything about the various DNS environments. Their task is to figure out which DNS entries are required in their realm and manage appropriate DNSEntry objects. From these objects they can also read the provisioning status and report it back to the original source.\nProvisioning of DNS entries in external DNS providers is done by DNS Provisioning Controllers. They don\u0026rsquo;t need to know anything about the various DNS source objects. They watch DNSEntry objects and check whether they are responsible for such an object. If a provisioning controller feels responsible for an entry it manages the corresponding settings in the external DNS environment and reports the provisioning status back to the corresponding DNSEntry object.\nTo do this a provisioning controller is responsible for a dedicated environment (for example Route53). For every such environment the controller uses a dedicated type key. This key is used to look for DNSProvider objects. There might be multiple such objects per environment, specifying the credentials needed to access different external accounts. These accounts are then scanned for DNS zones and domain names they support. This information is then used to dynamically assign DNSEntry objects to dedicated DNSProvider objects. If such an assignment can be done by a provisioning controller then it is responsible for this entry and manages the corresponding entries in the external environment. DNSProvider objects can specify explicit inclusion and exclusion sets of domain names and/or DNS zone identifiers to override the scanning results of the account.\nOwner Identifiers Every DNS Provisioning Controller is responsible for a set of Owner Identifiers. DNS records in an external DNS environment are attached to such an identifier. This is used to identify the records in the DNS environment managed by a dedicated controller (manager). Every controller manager hosting DNS Provisioning Controllers offers an option to specify a default identifier. Additionally there might be dedicated DNSOwner objects that enable or disable additional owner ids.\nEvery DNSEntry object may specify a dedicated owner that is used to tag the records in the DNS environment. A DNS provisioning controller only acts of DNS entries it is responsible for. Other resources in the external DNS environment are not touched at all.\nThis way it is possbible to\n identify records in the external DNS management environment that are managed by the actual controller instance distinguish different DNS source environments sharing the same hosted zones in the external management environment cleanup unused entries, even if the whole resource set is already gone move the responsibility for dedicated sets of DNS entries among different kubernetes clusters or DNS source environments running different DNS Provisioning Controller without loosing the entries during the migration process.  If multiple DNS controller instances have access to the same DNS zones, it is very important, that every instance uses a unique owner identifier! Otherwise the cleanup of stale DNS record will delete entries created by another instance if they use the same identifier.\nDNS Classes Multiple sets of controllers of the DNS ecosystem can run in parallel in a kubernetes cluster working on different object set. They are separated by using different DNS Classes. Adding a DNS class annotation to an object of the DNS ecosytems assigns this object to such a dedicated set of DNS controllers. This way it is possible to maintain clearly separated set of DNS objects in a single kubernetes cluster.\nDNSAnnotation objects DNS source controllers support the creation of DNS entries for potentiialy any kind of resource originally not equipped to describe the generation of DNS entries. This is done by additionally annotations. Nevertheless it might be the case, that those objects are again the result of a generation process, ether by predefined helm starts or by other higher level controllers. It is not necessarily possible to influence those generation steps to additionally generate the deired DNS annotations.\nThe typical mechanis in Kubernetes to handle this is to provide mutating webhooks that enrich the generated objects accordingly. But this mechanism is basically not intended to support dedicated settings for dedicated instances. At least it is very strenous to provide web hooks for every such usecase.\nTherefore the DNS ecosystem provided by this project supports an additional extension mechanism to annotate any kind of object with additional annotations by supported a dedicated resource, the DNSAnnotation.\nThe handling of this resource is done by a dedicated controller, the annotation controller. It caches the annotation settings declared by those objects and makes them accessible for the DNS source controllers.\nThe DNS source controller responsible for a dedicated kind of resource (for example Service reads the object analyses the annotations and then decides what to do with it. Most of the flow is handled by a central library, only some dedicated resource dependent steps are implemented separately by a dedicated source controller. The DNSAnnotationresource slightly extends this flow: After reading the object the library additionally checks for the existence of a DNSAnnotation setting for this object by querying the annotation controller\u0026rsquo;s cache. If found, it adds annotations declared there to the original object prior to the next processing steps. This way, for example whenver a Service without any DNS related annotation is handled by the controller and it finds a matching DNSAnnotation setting, the set of actual annotations is enriched accordingly before the actual processing of the service object is done by the controller.\nThis DNSAnnotation object can be created before or even after the object to be annotated and will implicity cause a reprocessing of the original object by its DNS source controller.\nFor example, the following object enforces a DNS related annotation for the processing of the service object testapp/default by the service DNS source controller:\napiVersion:dns.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:DNSAnnotationmetadata:name:testappspec:resourceRef:kind:ServiceapiVersion:v1name:testappannotations:dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames:testapp.dns.gardener.clouddns.gardener.cloud/ttl:\u0026#34;500\u0026#34;Using the DNS controller manager The controllers to run can be selected with the --controllers option. Here the following controller groups can be used:\n  dnssources: all DNS Source Controllers. It includes the conrollers\n ingress-dns: handle DNS annotations for the standard kubernetes ingress resource service-dns: handle DNS annotations for the standard kubernetes service resource    dnscontrollers: all DNS Provisioning Controllers. It includes the controllers\n alicloud-dns: aws-route53: azure-dns: google-clouddns: openstack-designate: cloudflare-dns    all: (default) all controllers\n  It is also possible to list dedicated controllers by their name.\nIf a DNS Provisioning Controller is enabled it is important to specify a unique controller identity using the --identifier option. This identifier is stored in the DNS system to identify the DNS entries managed by a dedicated controller. There should never be two DNS controllers with the same identifier running at the same time for the same DNS domains/accounts.\nHere is the complete list of options provided:\nUsage:

FinalizerDomain(\u0026#34;dns.gardener.cloud\u0026#34;). MustRegister(source.CONTROLLER_GROUP_DNS_SOURCES) } Complete examples can be found in the sub packages of pkg/controller/source.\nHow to implement Provisioning Controllers Provisioning controllers can be implemented based on the provisioning controller library in this repository and must implement the provider.DNSHandlerFactory interface. This factory returns implementations of the provider.DNSHandler interface that does the effective work for a dedicated set of hosted zones.\nThese factories can be embedded into a final controller manager (the runnable instance) in several ways:\n The factory can be used to create a dedicated controller. This controller can then be embedded into a controller manager, either in its own controller manger or together with other controllers. The factory can be added to a compound factory, able to handle multiple infrastructures. This one can then be used to create a dedicated controller, again.  Embedding a Factory into a Controller A provisioning controller can be implemented following this example:\npackage controller import ( \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/dns/provider\u0026#34; ) const CONTROLLER_NAME = \u0026#34;route53-dns-controller\u0026#34; func init() { provider.DNSController(CONTROLLER_NAME, \u0026amp;Factory{}). FinalizerDomain(\u0026#34;dns.gardener.cloud\u0026#34;). MustRegister(provider.CONTROLLER_GROUP_DNS_CONTROLLERS) } This controller can be embedded into a controller manager just by using an anonymous import of the controller package in the main package of a dedicated controller manager.\nComplete examples are available in the sub packages of pkg/controller/provider. They also show a typical set of implementation structures that help to structure the implementation of such controllers.\nThe provider implemented in this project always follow the same structure:\n the provider package contains the provider code the factory source file registers the factory at a default compound factory it contains a sub package controller, which contains the embedding of the factory into a dedicated controller  Embedding a Factory into a Compound Factory A provisioning controller based on a Compound Factory can be extended by a new provider factory by registering this factory at the compound factory. This could be done, for example, by using the default compound factory provided in package pkg/controller/provider/compound as shown here, where NewHandler is a function creating a dedicated handler for a dedicated provider type:\npackage aws import ( \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/compound\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/dns/provider\u0026#34; ) const TYPE_CODE = \u0026#34;aws-route53\u0026#34; var Factory = provider.NewDNSHandlerFactory(TYPE_CODE, NewHandler) func init() { compound.MustRegister(Factory) } The compound factory is then again embedded into a provisioning controller as shown in the previous section (see the controllersub package).\nSetting Up a Controller Manager One or multiple controller packages can be bundled into a controller manager, by implementing a main package like this:\npackage main import ( \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/controller-manager-library/pkg/controllermanager\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/\u0026lt;your controller package\u0026gt;\u0026#34; ... ) func main() { controllermanager.Start(\u0026#34;my-dns-controller-manager\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dns controller manager\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;some description\u0026#34;) } Using the standard Compound Provisioning Controller If the standard Compound Provisioning Controller should be used it is required to additionally add the anonymous imports for the providers intended to be embedded into the compound factory like this:\n Example Coding package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;os\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/controller-manager-library/pkg/controllermanager\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/compound/controller\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/\u0026lt;your provider\u0026gt;\u0026#34; ... ) func main() { controllermanager.Start(\u0026#34;dns-controller-manager\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dns controller manager\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nothing\u0026#34;) }  Multiple Cluster Support The controller implementations provided in this project are prepared to work with multiple clusters by using the features of the used controller manager library.\nThe DNS Source Controllers support two clusters:\n the default cluster is used to scan for source objects the logical cluster target is used to maintain the DNSEnry objects.  The DNS Provisioning Controllers also support two clusters:\n the default cluster is used to scan for DNSEntry objects. It is mapped to the logical cluster target the logical cluster provider is used to look to the DNSProvider objects and their related secrets.  If those controller types should be combined in a single controller manager, it can be configured to support three potential clusters with the source objects, the one for the entry objects and the one with provider objects using cluster mappings.\nThis is shown in a complete example using the dns source controllers, the compound provisioning controller configured to support all the included DNS provider type factories:\n Example Coding package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;os\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/controller-manager-library/pkg/controllermanager\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/controller-manager-library/pkg/controllermanager/cluster\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/controller-manager-library/pkg/controllermanager/controller\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/controller-manager-library/pkg/controllermanager/controller/mappings\u0026#34; dnsprovider \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/dns/provider\u0026#34; dnssource \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/dns/source\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/compound/controller\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/alicloud\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/aws\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/azure\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/google\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/openstack\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/cloudflare\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/source/ingress\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/source/service\u0026#34; ) func init() { // target cluster already defined in dns source controller package  cluster.Configure( dnsprovider.PROVIDER_CLUSTER, \u0026#34;providers\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cluster to look for provider objects\u0026#34;, ).Fallback(dnssource.TARGET_CLUSTER) mappings.ForControllerGroup(dnsprovider.CONTROLLER_GROUP_DNS_CONTROLLERS). Map(controller.CLUSTER_MAIN, dnssource.TARGET_CLUSTER).MustRegister() } func main() { controllermanager.Start(\u0026#34;dns-controller-manager\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dns controller manager\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nothing\u0026#34;) }  Those clusters can the be separated by registering their names together with command line option names. These can be used to specify different kubeconfig files for those clusters.\nBy default all logical clusters are mapped to the default physical cluster specified via --kubeconfig or default cluster access.\nIf multiple physical clusters are defined they can be specified by a corresponding cluster option defining the kubeconfig file used to access this cluster. If no such option is specified the default is used.\nTherefore, even if the configuration is prepared for multiple clusters, such a controller manager can easily work on a single cluster if no special options are given on the command line.\nWhy not using the community external-dns solution? Some of the reasons are context-specific, i.e. relate to Gardener\u0026rsquo;s highly dynamic requirements.\n Custom resource for DNS entries  DNS entries are explicitly specified as custom resources. As an important side effect, each DNS entry provides an own status. Simply by querying the Kubernetes API, a client can check if a requested DNS entry has been successfully added to the DNS backend, or if an update has already been deployed, or if not to reason about the cause. It also opens for easy extensibility, as DNS entries can be created directly via the Kubernetes API. And it simplifies Day 2 operations, e.g. automatic cleanup of unused entries if a DNS provider is deleted.\nManagement of multiple DNS providers  The Gardener DNS controller uses a custom resource DNSProvider to dynamically manage the backend DNS services. While with external-dns you have to specify the single provider during startup, in the Gardener DNS controller you can add/update/delete providers during runtime with different credentials and/or backends. This is important for a multi-tenant environment as in Gardener, where users can bring their own accounts.\nA DNS provider can also restrict its actions on subset of the DNS domains (includes and excludes) for which the credentials are capable to edit.\nEach provider can define a separate “owner” identifier, to differentiate DNS entries in the same DNS zone from different providers.\nMulti cluster support  The Gardener DNS controller distinguish three different logical Kubernetes clusters: Source cluster, target cluster and runtime cluster. The source cluster is monitored by the DNS source controllers for annotations on ingress and service resources. These controllers then create DNS entries in the target cluster. DNS entries in the target cluster are then reconciliated/synchronized with the corresponding DNS backend service by the provider controller. The runtime cluster is the cluster the DNS controller runs on. For example, this enables needed flexibility in the Gardener deployment. The DNS controller runs on the seed cluster. This is also the target cluster. DNS providers and entries resources are created in the corresponding namespace of the shoot control plane, while the source cluster is the shoot cluster itself.\nOptimizations for handling hundreds of DNS entries  Some DNS backend services are restricted on the API calls per second (e.g. the AWS Route 53 API). To manage hundreds of DNS entries it is important to minimize the number of API calls. The Gardener DNS controller heavily makes usage of caches and batch processing for this reason.\n"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/v1.13.2/concepts/networking/dns-managment/","title":"DNS Management","tags":[],"description":"","content":"External DNS Management The main artefact of this project is the DNS controller manager for managing DNS records, also nicknamed as the Gardener \u0026ldquo;DNS Controller\u0026rdquo;.\nIt contains provisioning controllers for creating DNS records in one of the DNS cloud services\n Amazon Route53, Google CloudDNS, AliCloud DNS, Azure DNS, OpenStack Designate, Cloudflare DNS, Infoblox,  and source controllers for services and ingresses to create DNS entries by annotations.\nThe configuration for the external DNS service is specified in a custom resource DNSProvider. Multiple DNSProvider can be used simultaneously and changed without restarting the DNS controller.\nDNS records are either created directly for a corresponding custom resource DNSEntry or by annotating a service or ingress.\nFor a detailed explanation of the model, see section The Model.\nFor extending or adapting this project with your own source or provisioning controllers, see section Extensions\nQuick start To install the DNS controller manager in your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps.\n  Prerequisites\n  Check out or download the project to get a copy of the Helm charts. It is recommended to check out the tag of the last release, so that Helm values reference the newest released container image for the deployment.\n  Make sure, that you have installed Helm client (helm) locally and Helm server (tiller) on the Kubernetes cluster. See e.g. Helm installation for more details.\n    Install the DNS controller manager\nAs multiple Gardener DNS controllers can act on the same DNS Hosted Zone concurrently, each instance needs an owner identifier. Therefore choose an identifier sufficiently unique across these instances.\nThen install the DNS controller manager with\nhelm install charts/external-dns-management --name dns-controller --namespace=\u0026lt;my-namespace\u0026gt; --set configuration.identifier=\u0026lt;my-identifier\u0026gt; This will use the default configuration with all source and provisioning controllers enabled. The complete set of configuration variables can be found in charts/external-dns-management/values.yaml. Their meaning is explained by their corresponding command line options in section Using the DNS controller manager\nBy default, the DNS controller looks for custom resources in all namespaces. The choosen namespace is only relevant for the deployment itself.\n  Create a DNSProvider\nTo specify a DNS provider, you need to create a custom resource DNSProvider and a secret containing the credentials for your account at the provider. E.g. if you want to use AWS Route53, create a secret and provider with\ncat \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: aws-credentials namespace: default type: Opaque data: # replace \u0026#39;...\u0026#39; with values encoded as base64 # see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ... AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ...

Depending on the provider and your DNS settings and cache, it may take up to a few minutes before the domain name can be resolved.\n  Wait for/check DNS record\nTo check the DNS resolution, use nslookup or dig.\nnslookup myentry.my-own-domain.com or with dig\n# or with dig dig +short myentry.my-own-domain.com Depending on your network settings, you may get a successful response faster using a public DNS server (e.g. 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4, or 1.1.1.1)\ndig @8.8.8.8 +short myentry.my-own-domain.com   For more examples about the custom resources and the annotations for services and ingresses see the examples directory.\nAutomatic creation of DNS entries for services and ingresses Using the source controllers, it is also possible to create DNS entries for services (of type LoadBalancer) and ingresses automatically. The resources only need to be annotated with some special values. In this case ensure that the source controllers are enabled on startup of the DNS controller manager, i.e. the value of the command line option --controllers must contain dnscontrollers or equal to all. The DNS source controllers watch resources on the default cluster and create DNS entries on the target cluster. As there can be multiple controllers active on the same cluster, you may need to set the correct DNSClass both for the controller and for the source resource by setting the annotation dns.gardener.cloud/class. The default value for the DNSClass is gardendns.\nNote that if you delegate the DNS management for shoot resources to Gardener via the shoot-dns-service extension, the correct annotation is dns.gardener.cloud/class=garden.\nHere is an example for annotating a service (same as examples/50-service-with-dns.yaml)]:\napiVersion:v1kind:Servicemetadata:annotations:dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames:echo.my-dns-domain.comdns.gardener.cloud/ttl:\u0026#34;500\u0026#34;# If you are delegating the DNS Management to Gardener, uncomment the following line (see https://gardener.cloud/documentation/guides/administer_shoots/dns_names/)#`dns.gardener.cloud/class`: gardenname:test-servicenamespace:defaultspec:ports:- name:httpport:80protocol:TCPtargetPort:8080sessionAffinity:Nonetype:LoadBalancerThe Model This project provides a flexible model allowing to add DNS source objects and DNS provisioning environments by adding new independent controllers.\nThere is no single DNS controller anymore. The decoupling between the handling of DNS source objects, like ingresses or services, and the provisioning of DNS entries in an external DNS provider like Route53 or CloudDNS is achieved by introducing a new custom resource DNSEntry.\nThese objects can either be explicitly created to request dedicated DNS entries, or they are managed based on other resources like ingresses or services. For the latter dedicated DNS Source Controllers are used. There might be any number of such source controllers. They do not need to know anything about the various DNS environments. Their task is to figure out which DNS entries are required in their realm and manage appropriate DNSEntry objects. From these objects they can also read the provisioning status and report it back to the original source.\nProvisioning of DNS entries in external DNS providers is done by DNS Provisioning Controllers. They don\u0026rsquo;t need to know anything about the various DNS source objects. They watch DNSEntry objects and check whether they are responsible for such an object. If a provisioning controller feels responsible for an entry it manages the corresponding settings in the external DNS environment and reports the provisioning status back to the corresponding DNSEntry object.\nTo do this a provisioning controller is responsible for a dedicated environment (for example Route53). For every such environment the controller uses a dedicated type key. This key is used to look for DNSProvider objects. There might be multiple such objects per environment, specifying the credentials needed to access different external accounts. These accounts are then scanned for DNS zones and domain names they support. This information is then used to dynamically assign DNSEntry objects to dedicated DNSProvider objects. If such an assignment can be done by a provisioning controller then it is responsible for this entry and manages the corresponding entries in the external environment. DNSProvider objects can specify explicit inclusion and exclusion sets of domain names and/or DNS zone identifiers to override the scanning results of the account.\nOwner Identifiers Every DNS Provisioning Controller is responsible for a set of Owner Identifiers. DNS records in an external DNS environment are attached to such an identifier. This is used to identify the records in the DNS environment managed by a dedicated controller (manager). Every controller manager hosting DNS Provisioning Controllers offers an option to specify a default identifier. Additionally there might be dedicated DNSOwner objects that enable or disable additional owner ids.\nEvery DNSEntry object may specify a dedicated owner that is used to tag the records in the DNS environment. A DNS provisioning controller only acts of DNS entries it is responsible for. Other resources in the external DNS environment are not touched at all.\nThis way it is possbible to\n identify records in the external DNS management environment that are managed by the actual controller instance distinguish different DNS source environments sharing the same hosted zones in the external management environment cleanup unused entries, even if the whole resource set is already gone move the responsibility for dedicated sets of DNS entries among different kubernetes clusters or DNS source environments running different DNS Provisioning Controller without loosing the entries during the migration process.  If multiple DNS controller instances have access to the same DNS zones, it is very important, that every instance uses a unique owner identifier! Otherwise the cleanup of stale DNS record will delete entries created by another instance if they use the same identifier.\nDNS Classes Multiple sets of controllers of the DNS ecosystem can run in parallel in a kubernetes cluster working on different object set. They are separated by using different DNS Classes. Adding a DNS class annotation to an object of the DNS ecosytems assigns this object to such a dedicated set of DNS controllers. This way it is possible to maintain clearly separated set of DNS objects in a single kubernetes cluster.\nDNSAnnotation objects DNS source controllers support the creation of DNS entries for potentiialy any kind of resource originally not equipped to describe the generation of DNS entries. This is done by additionally annotations. Nevertheless it might be the case, that those objects are again the result of a generation process, ether by predefined helm starts or by other higher level controllers. It is not necessarily possible to influence those generation steps to additionally generate the deired DNS annotations.\nThe typical mechanis in Kubernetes to handle this is to provide mutating webhooks that enrich the generated objects accordingly. But this mechanism is basically not intended to support dedicated settings for dedicated instances. At least it is very strenous to provide web hooks for every such usecase.\nTherefore the DNS ecosystem provided by this project supports an additional extension mechanism to annotate any kind of object with additional annotations by supported a dedicated resource, the DNSAnnotation.\nThe handling of this resource is done by a dedicated controller, the annotation controller. It caches the annotation settings declared by those objects and makes them accessible for the DNS source controllers.\nThe DNS source controller responsible for a dedicated kind of resource (for example Service reads the object analyses the annotations and then decides what to do with it. Most of the flow is handled by a central library, only some dedicated resource dependent steps are implemented separately by a dedicated source controller. The DNSAnnotationresource slightly extends this flow: After reading the object the library additionally checks for the existence of a DNSAnnotation setting for this object by querying the annotation controller\u0026rsquo;s cache. If found, it adds annotations declared there to the original object prior to the next processing steps. This way, for example whenver a Service without any DNS related annotation is handled by the controller and it finds a matching DNSAnnotation setting, the set of actual annotations is enriched accordingly before the actual processing of the service object is done by the controller.\nThis DNSAnnotation object can be created before or even after the object to be annotated and will implicity cause a reprocessing of the original object by its DNS source controller.\nFor example, the following object enforces a DNS related annotation for the processing of the service object testapp/default by the service DNS source controller:\napiVersion:dns.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:DNSAnnotationmetadata:name:testappspec:resourceRef:kind:ServiceapiVersion:v1name:testappannotations:dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames:testapp.dns.gardener.clouddns.gardener.cloud/ttl:\u0026#34;500\u0026#34;Using the DNS controller manager The controllers to run can be selected with the --controllers option. Here the following controller groups can be used:\n  dnssources: all DNS Source Controllers. It includes the conrollers\n ingress-dns: handle DNS annotations for the standard kubernetes ingress resource service-dns: handle DNS annotations for the standard kubernetes service resource    dnscontrollers: all DNS Provisioning Controllers. It includes the controllers\n alicloud-dns: aws-route53: azure-dns: google-clouddns: openstack-designate: cloudflare-dns    all: (default) all controllers\n  It is also possible to list dedicated controllers by their name.\nIf a DNS Provisioning Controller is enabled it is important to specify a unique controller identity using the --identifier option. This identifier is stored in the DNS system to identify the DNS entries managed by a dedicated controller. There should never be two DNS controllers with the same identifier running at the same time for the same DNS domains/accounts.\nHere is the complete list of options provided:\nUsage:

Defines how long the record is kept in cache by DNS servers or resolvers. --version version for dns-controller-manager Extensions This project can also be used as library to implement own source and provisioning controllers.\nHow to implement Source Controllers Based on the provided source controller library a source controller must implement the source.DNSSource interface and provide an appropriate creator function.\nA source controller can be implemented following this example:\npackage service import ( \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/controller-manager-library/pkg/resources\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/dns/source\u0026#34; ) var _MAIN_RESOURCE = resources.NewGroupKind(\u0026#34;core\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Service\u0026#34;) func init() { source.DNSSourceController(source.NewDNSSouceTypeForExtractor(\u0026#34;service-dns\u0026#34;, _MAIN_RESOURCE, GetTargets),nil). FinalizerDomain(\u0026#34;dns.gardener.cloud\u0026#34;). MustRegister(source.CONTROLLER_GROUP_DNS_SOURCES) } Complete examples can be found in the sub packages of pkg/controller/source.\nHow to implement Provisioning Controllers Provisioning controllers can be implemented based on the provisioning controller library in this repository and must implement the provider.DNSHandlerFactory interface. This factory returns implementations of the provider.DNSHandler interface that does the effective work for a dedicated set of hosted zones.\nThese factories can be embedded into a final controller manager (the runnable instance) in several ways:\n The factory can be used to create a dedicated controller. This controller can then be embedded into a controller manager, either in its own controller manger or together with other controllers. The factory can be added to a compound factory, able to handle multiple infrastructures. This one can then be used to create a dedicated controller, again.  Embedding a Factory into a Controller A provisioning controller can be implemented following this example:\npackage controller import ( \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/dns/provider\u0026#34; ) const CONTROLLER_NAME = \u0026#34;route53-dns-controller\u0026#34; func init() { provider.DNSController(CONTROLLER_NAME, \u0026amp;Factory{}). FinalizerDomain(\u0026#34;dns.gardener.cloud\u0026#34;). MustRegister(provider.CONTROLLER_GROUP_DNS_CONTROLLERS) } This controller can be embedded into a controller manager just by using an anonymous import of the controller package in the main package of a dedicated controller manager.\nComplete examples are available in the sub packages of pkg/controller/provider. They also show a typical set of implementation structures that help to structure the implementation of such controllers.\nThe provider implemented in this project always follow the same structure:\n the provider package contains the provider code the factory source file registers the factory at a default compound factory it contains a sub package controller, which contains the embedding of the factory into a dedicated controller  Embedding a Factory into a Compound Factory A provisioning controller based on a Compound Factory can be extended by a new provider factory by registering this factory at the compound factory. This could be done, for example, by using the default compound factory provided in package pkg/controller/provider/compound as shown here, where NewHandler is a function creating a dedicated handler for a dedicated provider type:\npackage aws import ( \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/compound\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/dns/provider\u0026#34; ) const TYPE_CODE = \u0026#34;aws-route53\u0026#34; var Factory = provider.NewDNSHandlerFactory(TYPE_CODE, NewHandler) func init() { compound.MustRegister(Factory) } The compound factory is then again embedded into a provisioning controller as shown in the previous section (see the controllersub package).\nSetting Up a Controller Manager One or multiple controller packages can be bundled into a controller manager, by implementing a main package like this:\npackage main import ( \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/controller-manager-library/pkg/controllermanager\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/\u0026lt;your controller package\u0026gt;\u0026#34; ... ) func main() { controllermanager.Start(\u0026#34;my-dns-controller-manager\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dns controller manager\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;some description\u0026#34;) } Using the standard Compound Provisioning Controller If the standard Compound Provisioning Controller should be used it is required to additionally add the anonymous imports for the providers intended to be embedded into the compound factory like this:\n Example Coding package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;os\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/controller-manager-library/pkg/controllermanager\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/compound/controller\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/\u0026lt;your provider\u0026gt;\u0026#34; ... ) func main() { controllermanager.Start(\u0026#34;dns-controller-manager\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dns controller manager\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nothing\u0026#34;) }  Multiple Cluster Support The controller implementations provided in this project are prepared to work with multiple clusters by using the features of the used controller manager library.\nThe DNS Source Controllers support two clusters:\n the default cluster is used to scan for source objects the logical cluster target is used to maintain the DNSEnry objects.  The DNS Provisioning Controllers also support two clusters:\n the default cluster is used to scan for DNSEntry objects. It is mapped to the logical cluster target the logical cluster provider is used to look to the DNSProvider objects and their related secrets.  If those controller types should be combined in a single controller manager, it can be configured to support three potential clusters with the source objects, the one for the entry objects and the one with provider objects using cluster mappings.\nThis is shown in a complete example using the dns source controllers, the compound provisioning controller configured to support all the included DNS provider type factories:\n Example Coding package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;os\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/controller-manager-library/pkg/controllermanager\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/controller-manager-library/pkg/controllermanager/cluster\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/controller-manager-library/pkg/controllermanager/controller\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/controller-manager-library/pkg/controllermanager/controller/mappings\u0026#34; dnsprovider \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/dns/provider\u0026#34; dnssource \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/dns/source\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/compound/controller\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/alicloud\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/aws\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/azure\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/google\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/openstack\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/provider/cloudflare\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/source/ingress\u0026#34; _ \u0026#34;github.com/gardener/external-dns-management/pkg/controller/source/service\u0026#34; ) func init() { // target cluster already defined in dns source controller package  cluster.Configure( dnsprovider.PROVIDER_CLUSTER, \u0026#34;providers\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cluster to look for provider objects\u0026#34;, ).Fallback(dnssource.TARGET_CLUSTER) mappings.ForControllerGroup(dnsprovider.CONTROLLER_GROUP_DNS_CONTROLLERS). Map(controller.CLUSTER_MAIN, dnssource.TARGET_CLUSTER).MustRegister() } func main() { controllermanager.Start(\u0026#34;dns-controller-manager\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dns controller manager\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nothing\u0026#34;) }  Those clusters can the be separated by registering their names together with command line option names. These can be used to specify different kubeconfig files for those clusters.\nBy default all logical clusters are mapped to the default physical cluster specified via --kubeconfig or default cluster access.\nIf multiple physical clusters are defined they can be specified by a corresponding cluster option defining the kubeconfig file used to access this cluster. If no such option is specified the default is used.\nTherefore, even if the configuration is prepared for multiple clusters, such a controller manager can easily work on a single cluster if no special options are given on the command line.\nWhy not using the community external-dns solution? Some of the reasons are context-specific, i.e. relate to Gardener\u0026rsquo;s highly dynamic requirements.\n Custom resource for DNS entries  DNS entries are explicitly specified as custom resources. As an important side effect, each DNS entry provides an own status. Simply by querying the Kubernetes API, a client can check if a requested DNS entry has been successfully added to the DNS backend, or if an update has already been deployed, or if not to reason about the cause. It also opens for easy extensibility, as DNS entries can be created directly via the Kubernetes API. And it simplifies Day 2 operations, e.g. automatic cleanup of unused entries if a DNS provider is deleted.\nManagement of multiple DNS providers  The Gardener DNS controller uses a custom resource DNSProvider to dynamically manage the backend DNS services. While with external-dns you have to specify the single provider during startup, in the Gardener DNS controller you can add/update/delete providers during runtime with different credentials and/or backends. This is important for a multi-tenant environment as in Gardener, where users can bring their own accounts.\nA DNS provider can also restrict its actions on subset of the DNS domains (includes and excludes) for which the credentials are capable to edit.\nEach provider can define a separate “owner” identifier, to differentiate DNS entries in the same DNS zone from different providers.\nMulti cluster support  The Gardener DNS controller distinguish three different logical Kubernetes clusters: Source cluster, target cluster and runtime cluster. The source cluster is monitored by the DNS source controllers for annotations on ingress and service resources. These controllers then create DNS entries in the target cluster. DNS entries in the target cluster are then reconciliated/synchronized with the corresponding DNS backend service by the provider controller. The runtime cluster is the cluster the DNS controller runs on. For example, this enables needed flexibility in the Gardener deployment. The DNS controller runs on the seed cluster. This is also the target cluster. DNS providers and entries resources are created in the corresponding namespace of the shoot control plane, while the source cluster is the shoot cluster itself.\nOptimizations for handling hundreds of DNS entries  Some DNS backend services are restricted on the API calls per second (e.g. the AWS Route 53 API). To manage hundreds of DNS entries it is important to minimize the number of API calls. The Gardener DNS controller heavily makes usage of caches and batch processing for this reason.\n"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/documentation/concepts/core-components/api-server/","title":"Gardener API Server","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Gardener API server The Gardener API server is a Kubernetes-native extension based on its aggregation layer.

We take a so-called \u0026ldquo;seed\u0026rdquo; cluster and seed the control plane (such as the API server, scheduler, controllers, etcd persistence and others) of an end-user cluster, which we call \u0026ldquo;shoot\u0026rdquo; cluster, as pods into the \u0026ldquo;seed\u0026rdquo; cluster. That means one \u0026ldquo;seed\u0026rdquo; cluster, of which we will have one per IaaS and region, hosts the control planes of multiple \u0026ldquo;shoot\u0026rdquo; clusters. That allows us to avoid dedicated hardware/virtual machines for the \u0026ldquo;shoot\u0026rdquo; cluster control planes. We simply put the control plane into pods/containers and since the \u0026ldquo;seed\u0026rdquo; cluster watches them, they can be deployed with a replica count of 1 and only need to be scaled out when the control plane gets under pressure, but no longer for HA reasons. At the same time, the deployments get simpler (standard Kubernetes deployment) and easier to update (standard Kubernetes rolling update). The actual \u0026ldquo;shoot\u0026rdquo; cluster consists only out of the worker nodes (no control plane) and therefore the users may get full administrative access to their clusters.\nSetting The Scene - Components and Procedure We provide a central operator UI, which we call the \u0026ldquo;Gardener Dashboard\u0026rdquo;. It talks to a dedicated cluster, which we call the \u0026ldquo;Garden\u0026rdquo; cluster and uses custom resources managed by an aggregated API server, one of the general extension concepts of Kubernetes) to represent \u0026ldquo;shoot\u0026rdquo; clusters. In this \u0026ldquo;Garden\u0026rdquo; cluster runs the \u0026ldquo;Gardener\u0026rdquo;, which is basically a Kubernetes controller that watches the custom resources and acts upon them, i.e. creates, updates/modifies, or deletes \u0026ldquo;shoot\u0026rdquo; clusters.

With this project the separation of concerns between multiple clusters is realized more easily. The cert-controller-manager runs in a secured cluster where the issuer secrets are stored. At the same time it watches an untrusted source cluster and can provide certificates for it. The cert-controller-manager relies on DNS challenges (ACME only) for validating the domain names of the certificates. For this purpose it creates DNSEntry custom resources (in a possible separate dns cluster) to be handled by the compagnion dns-controller-manager from external-dns-management.\nCurrently, the cert-controller-manager supports certificate authorities via:\n Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol like Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt. Certificate Authority (CA): an existing certificate and a private key provided as a TLS Secret.  Setting up Issuers Before you can obtain certificates from a certificate authority (CA), you need to set up an issuer. The issuer is specified in the default cluster, while the certificates are specified in the source cluster.\nThe issuer custom resource contains the configuration and registration data for your account at the CA.\nAutomatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Two modes are supported:\n auto registration using an existing account  Auto registration Auto registration is mainly used for development and test environments. You only need to provide the server URL and an email address. The registration process is done automatically for you by creating a private key and performing the registration at the CA. Optionally you can provide the target secret with the privateKeySecretRef section.\nFor example see examples/20-issuer-staging.yaml:\napiVersion:cert.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Issuermetadata:name:issuer-stagingnamespace:defaultspec:acme:server:https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directoryemail:some.user@mydomain.comautoRegistration:true# with \u0026#39;autoRegistration: true\u0026#39; a new account will be created if the secretRef is not existingprivateKeySecretRef:name:issuer-staging-secretnamespace:defaultUsing existing account If you already have an existing account at the certificate authority, you need to specify email address and reference the private key from a secret.\napiVersion:v1kind:Secretmetadata:name:my-issuer-secretnamespace:defaulttype:Opaquedata:privateKey:LS0tLS1...apiVersion:cert.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Issuermetadata:name:my-issuernamespace:defaultspec:acme:server:https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directoryemail:my.account@mydomain.comprivateKeySecretRef:name:my-issuer-secretnamespace:defaultIn both cases, the state of an issuer resource can be checked on the default cluster with\n▶ kubectl get issuer NAME SERVER EMAIL STATUS TYPE AGE issuer-staging https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory some.user@mydomain.com Ready acme 8s Certificate Authority (CA) This issuer is meant to be used where a central Certificate Authority is already in place. The operator must request/provide by its own means a CA or an intermediate CA. This is mainly used for on-premises and airgapped environements.\nIt can also be used for developement or testing purproses. In this case a Self-signed Certificate Authority can be created by following the section below.\nCreate a Self-signed Certificate Authority (optional)\n▶ openssl genrsa -out CA-key.pem 4096 ▶ export CONFIG=\u0026#34; [req] distinguished_name=dn [ dn ] [ ext ] basicConstraints=CA:TRUE,pathlen:0 \u0026#34; ▶ openssl req \\  -new -nodes -x509 -config \u0026lt;(echo \u0026#34;$CONFIG\u0026#34;) -key CA-key.pem \\  -subj \u0026#34;/CN=Hello\u0026#34; -extensions ext -days 1000 -out CA-cert.pem Create a TLS secret from the certificate CA-cert.pem and the private key CA-key.pem\n▶ kubectl -n default create secret tls issuer-ca-secret \\  --cert=CA-cert.pem --key=CA-key.pem -oyaml \\  --dry-run=client \u0026gt; secret.yaml The content of the secret.yaml should look like the following, for a full example see examples/20-issuer-ca.yaml\napiVersion:v1data:tls.crt:{base64certificate}tls.key:{base64privatekey}kind:Secretmetadata:name:issuer-ca-secrettype:kubernetes.io/tlsApply the secrets in the cluster and create the issuer, for example see examples/20-issuer-ca.yaml\n---apiVersion:cert.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Issuermetadata:name:issuer-canamespace:defaultspec:ca:privateKeySecretRef:name:issuer-ca-secretnamespace:defaultThe state of the issuer resource can be checked on the default cluster with\n▶ kubectl get issuer NAME SERVER EMAIL STATUS TYPE AGE issuer-ca Ready ca 6s Some details about the CA can be found in the status of the issuer.\n▶ kubectl get issuer issuer-ca -ojsonpath=\u0026#39;{.status}\u0026#39; | jq \u0026#39;.\u0026#39; { \u0026#34;ca\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;NotAfter\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2023-05-31T14:55:55Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;NotBefore\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-09-03T14:55:55Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Subject\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;CommonName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-domain.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Country\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;DE\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Locality\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;Walldorf\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Organization\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;Gardener\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;OrganizationalUnit\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;Gardener\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;PostalCode\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;Province\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;BW\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;SerialNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1E04A2C8F057AC890F45FEC5446AE4DDA73EA1D5\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;StreetAddress\u0026#34;: null } }, \u0026#34;observedGeneration\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;requestsPerDayQuota\u0026#34;: 10000, \u0026#34;state\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Ready\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ca\u0026#34; } Requesting a Certificate To obtain a certificate for a domain, you specify a certificate custom resource on the source cluster. You can specify the issuer explicitly by reference. If there is no issuer reference, the default issuer is used (provided as command line option). You must either specify the commonName and further optional dnsNames or you can also start with a certificate signing request (CSR).\nFor domain validation, the cert-controller-manager only supports DNS challenges. For this purpose it relies on the dns-controller-manager from the external-dns-management project. If any domain name (commonName or any item from dnsNames) needs to be validated, it creates a custom resource DNSEntry in the dns cluster. When the certificate authority sees the temporary DNS record, the certificate is stored in a secret finally. The name of the secret can be specified explicitly with secretName and will be stored in the same namespace as the certificate on the source cluster.\nThe certificate is checked for renewal periodically. The renewal is performed automatically and the secret is updated. Default values for periodical check is daily, the certificate is renewed if its validity expires within 60 days.\nUsing commonName and optional dnsNames For example see examples/30-cert-simple.yaml:\napiVersion:cert.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Certificatemetadata:name:cert-simplenamespace:defaultspec:commonName:cert1.mydomain.comdnsNames:- cert1-foo.mydomain.com- cert1-bar.mydomain.com# if issuer is not specified, the default issuer is usedissuerRef:name:issuer-stagingUsing a certificate signing request (CSR) You can provide a complete CSR in PEM format (and encoded as Base64).\nFor example see examples/30-cert-csr.yaml:\napiVersion:cert.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Certificatemetadata:name:cert-csrnamespace:defaultspec:csr:LS0tLS1CRUd...issuerRef:name:issuer-staging:warning: Using a CSR is only available for ACME Issuer\nRequesting a Certificate for Ingress Add the annotation cert.gardener.cloud/purpose: managed to the Ingress resource. The cert-controller-manager will then automatically request a certificate for all domains given by the hosts in the tls section of the Ingress spec.\nFor compatibility with the Gardener Cert-Broker, you can alternatively use the deprecated label garden.sapcloud.io/purpose: managed-cert for the same outcome.\nSee also examples/40-ingress-echoheaders.yaml:\nProcess   Create the Ingress Resource (optional)\nIn order to request a certificate for a domain managed by cert-controller-manager an Ingress is required. In case you don’t already have one, take the following as an example:\napiVersion:networking.k8s.io/v1beta1kind:Ingressmetadata:name:vuejs-ingressspec:tls:# Gardener managed default domain.# The first host is used as common name and must not exceed 64 characters- hosts:- test.ingress.\u0026lt;GARDENER-CLUSTER\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;GARDENER-PROJECT\u0026gt;.shoot.example.com# Certificate and private key reside in this secret.secretName:testsecret-tlsrules:- host:test.ingress.\u0026lt;GARDENER-CLUSTER\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;GARDENER-PROJECT\u0026gt;.shoot.example.comhttp:paths:- backend:serviceName:vuejs-svcservicePort:8080  Annotate the Ingress Resource\nThe annotation cert.gardener.cloud/purpose: managed instructs cert-controller-manager to handle certificate issuance for the domains found in labeled Ingress.\napiVersion:networking.k8s.io/v1beta1kind:Ingressmetadata:name:tls-example-ingressannotations:# Let Gardener manage certificates for this Ingress.cert.gardener.cloud/purpose:managed#dns.gardener.cloud/class: garden # needed on Gardener shoot clusters for managed DNS record creation (if not covered by `*.ingress.\u0026lt;GARDENER-CLUSTER\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;GARDENER-PROJECT\u0026gt;.shoot.example.com)#cert.gardener.cloud/commonname: \u0026#34;*.demo.mydomain.com\u0026#34; # optional, if not specified the first name from spec.tls[].hosts is used as common name#cert.gardener.cloud/dnsnames: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # optional, if not specified the names from spec.tls[].hosts are usedspec:tls:- hosts:- echoheaders.demo.mydomain.comsecretName:cert-echoheadersrules:- host:echoheaders.demo.mydomain.comhttp:paths:- backend:serviceName:echoheadersservicePort:80path:/The annotation cert.gardener.cloud/commonname can be set to explicitly specify the common name. If no set, the first name of spec.tls.hosts is used as common name. The annotation cert.gardener.cloud/dnsnames can be used to explicitly specify the alternative DNS names. If no set, the names of spec.tls.hosts are used.\n  Check status\nA certificate custom resource is created in the same namespace of the source cluster. You can either check the status of this certificate resource with kubectl get cert or you can check the events for the ingress with kubectl get events\nThe certificate is stored in the secret as specified in the Ingress resource.\n  Requesting a Certificate for Service If you have a service of type LoadBalancer, you can use the annotation cert.gardener.cloud/secretname together with the annotation dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames from the dns-controller-manager to trigger automatic creation of a certificate. If you wan to share a certificate between multiple services and ingresses, using the annotations cert.gardener.cloud/commonname and cert.gardener.cloud/dnsnames may be helpful.\napiVersion:v1kind:Servicemetadata:annotations:cert.gardener.cloud/secretname:test-service-secretdns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames:test-service.demo.mydomain.com#dns.gardener.cloud/class: garden # needed on Gardener shoot clusters for managed DNS record creation#cert.gardener.cloud/commonname: \u0026#34;*.demo.mydomain.com\u0026#34; # optional, if not specified the first name from dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames is used as common name#cert.gardener.cloud/dnsnames: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # optional, if specified overrides dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames annotation for certificate namesdns.gardener.cloud/ttl:\u0026#34;600\u0026#34;name:test-servicenamespace:defaultspec:ports:- name:httpport:80protocol:TCPtargetPort:8080type:LoadBalancerThe annotation cert.gardener.cloud/commonname is optional. If not specified, the first name of the annotation dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames is used as common name. It is useful to specify it explicitly, if no DNSEntry should be created for the common name by the dns-controller-manager. A typical use case is if the common name (limited to 64 characters) is set only to deal with real domain names specified with dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames which are longer than 64 characters. The annotation cert.gardener.cloud/dnsnames can be used to explicitly specify the alternative DNS names. If set, it overrides the values from the annotation dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames for the certificate (but not for creating DNS records by the dns-controller-manager).\nIf you want to share a certificate between multiple services and ingresses, using the annotations cert.gardener.cloud/commonname and cert.gardener.cloud/dnsnames may be helpful. For example, to share a wildcard certificate, you should add these two annotations\ncert.gardener.cloud/commonname:\u0026#34;*.demo.mydomain.com\u0026#34;cert.gardener.cloud/dnsnames:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;This will create or reuse a certificate for *.demo.mydomain.com.

With this project the separation of concerns between multiple clusters is realized more easily. The cert-controller-manager runs in a secured cluster where the issuer secrets are stored. At the same time it watches an untrusted source cluster and can provide certificates for it. The cert-controller-manager relies on DNS challenges (ACME only) for validating the domain names of the certificates. For this purpose it creates DNSEntry custom resources (in a possible separate dns cluster) to be handled by the compagnion dns-controller-manager from external-dns-management.\nCurrently, the cert-controller-manager supports certificate authorities via:\n Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol like Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt. Certificate Authority (CA): an existing certificate and a private key provided as a TLS Secret.  Setting up Issuers Before you can obtain certificates from a certificate authority (CA), you need to set up an issuer. The issuer is specified in the default cluster, while the certificates are specified in the source cluster.\nThe issuer custom resource contains the configuration and registration data for your account at the CA.\nAutomatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Two modes are supported:\n auto registration using an existing account  Auto registration Auto registration is mainly used for development and test environments. You only need to provide the server URL and an email address. The registration process is done automatically for you by creating a private key and performing the registration at the CA. Optionally you can provide the target secret with the privateKeySecretRef section.\nFor example see examples/20-issuer-staging.yaml:\napiVersion:cert.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Issuermetadata:name:issuer-stagingnamespace:defaultspec:acme:server:https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directoryemail:some.user@mydomain.comautoRegistration:true# with \u0026#39;autoRegistration: true\u0026#39; a new account will be created if the secretRef is not existingprivateKeySecretRef:name:issuer-staging-secretnamespace:defaultUsing existing account If you already have an existing account at the certificate authority, you need to specify email address and reference the private key from a secret.\napiVersion:v1kind:Secretmetadata:name:my-issuer-secretnamespace:defaulttype:Opaquedata:privateKey:LS0tLS1...apiVersion:cert.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Issuermetadata:name:my-issuernamespace:defaultspec:acme:server:https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directoryemail:my.account@mydomain.comprivateKeySecretRef:name:my-issuer-secretnamespace:defaultIn both cases, the state of an issuer resource can be checked on the default cluster with\n▶ kubectl get issuer NAME SERVER EMAIL STATUS TYPE AGE issuer-staging https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory some.user@mydomain.com Ready acme 8s Certificate Authority (CA) This issuer is meant to be used where a central Certificate Authority is already in place. The operator must request/provide by its own means a CA or an intermediate CA. This is mainly used for on-premises and airgapped environements.\nIt can also be used for developement or testing purproses. In this case a Self-signed Certificate Authority can be created by following the section below.\nCreate a Self-signed Certificate Authority (optional)\n▶ openssl genrsa -out CA-key.pem 4096 ▶ export CONFIG=\u0026#34; [req] distinguished_name=dn [ dn ] [ ext ] basicConstraints=CA:TRUE,pathlen:0 \u0026#34; ▶ openssl req \\  -new -nodes -x509 -config \u0026lt;(echo \u0026#34;$CONFIG\u0026#34;) -key CA-key.pem \\  -subj \u0026#34;/CN=Hello\u0026#34; -extensions ext -days 1000 -out CA-cert.pem Create a TLS secret from the certificate CA-cert.pem and the private key CA-key.pem\n▶ kubectl -n default create secret tls issuer-ca-secret \\  --cert=CA-cert.pem --key=CA-key.pem -oyaml \\  --dry-run=client \u0026gt; secret.yaml The content of the secret.yaml should look like the following, for a full example see examples/20-issuer-ca.yaml\napiVersion:v1data:tls.crt:{base64certificate}tls.key:{base64privatekey}kind:Secretmetadata:name:issuer-ca-secrettype:kubernetes.io/tlsApply the secrets in the cluster and create the issuer, for example see examples/20-issuer-ca.yaml\n---apiVersion:cert.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Issuermetadata:name:issuer-canamespace:defaultspec:ca:privateKeySecretRef:name:issuer-ca-secretnamespace:defaultThe state of the issuer resource can be checked on the default cluster with\n▶ kubectl get issuer NAME SERVER EMAIL STATUS TYPE AGE issuer-ca Ready ca 6s Some details about the CA can be found in the status of the issuer.\n▶ kubectl get issuer issuer-ca -ojsonpath=\u0026#39;{.status}\u0026#39; | jq \u0026#39;.\u0026#39; { \u0026#34;ca\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;NotAfter\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2023-05-31T14:55:55Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;NotBefore\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-09-03T14:55:55Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Subject\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;CommonName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-domain.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Country\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;DE\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Locality\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;Walldorf\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Organization\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;Gardener\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;OrganizationalUnit\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;Gardener\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;PostalCode\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;Province\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;BW\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;SerialNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1E04A2C8F057AC890F45FEC5446AE4DDA73EA1D5\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;StreetAddress\u0026#34;: null } }, \u0026#34;observedGeneration\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;requestsPerDayQuota\u0026#34;: 10000, \u0026#34;state\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Ready\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ca\u0026#34; } Requesting a Certificate To obtain a certificate for a domain, you specify a certificate custom resource on the source cluster. You can specify the issuer explicitly by reference. If there is no issuer reference, the default issuer is used (provided as command line option). You must either specify the commonName and further optional dnsNames or you can also start with a certificate signing request (CSR).\nFor domain validation, the cert-controller-manager only supports DNS challenges. For this purpose it relies on the dns-controller-manager from the external-dns-management project. If any domain name (commonName or any item from dnsNames) needs to be validated, it creates a custom resource DNSEntry in the dns cluster. When the certificate authority sees the temporary DNS record, the certificate is stored in a secret finally. The name of the secret can be specified explicitly with secretName and will be stored in the same namespace as the certificate on the source cluster.\nThe certificate is checked for renewal periodically. The renewal is performed automatically and the secret is updated. Default values for periodical check is daily, the certificate is renewed if its validity expires within 60 days.\nUsing commonName and optional dnsNames For example see examples/30-cert-simple.yaml:\napiVersion:cert.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Certificatemetadata:name:cert-simplenamespace:defaultspec:commonName:cert1.mydomain.comdnsNames:- cert1-foo.mydomain.com- cert1-bar.mydomain.com# if issuer is not specified, the default issuer is usedissuerRef:name:issuer-stagingUsing a certificate signing request (CSR) You can provide a complete CSR in PEM format (and encoded as Base64).\nFor example see examples/30-cert-csr.yaml:\napiVersion:cert.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Certificatemetadata:name:cert-csrnamespace:defaultspec:csr:LS0tLS1CRUd...issuerRef:name:issuer-staging:warning: Using a CSR is only available for ACME Issuer\nRequesting a Certificate for Ingress Add the annotation cert.gardener.cloud/purpose: managed to the Ingress resource. The cert-controller-manager will then automatically request a certificate for all domains given by the hosts in the tls section of the Ingress spec.\nFor compatibility with the Gardener Cert-Broker, you can alternatively use the deprecated label garden.sapcloud.io/purpose: managed-cert for the same outcome.\nSee also examples/40-ingress-echoheaders.yaml:\nProcess   Create the Ingress Resource (optional)\nIn order to request a certificate for a domain managed by cert-controller-manager an Ingress is required. In case you don’t already have one, take the following as an example:\napiVersion:networking.k8s.io/v1beta1kind:Ingressmetadata:name:vuejs-ingressspec:tls:# Gardener managed default domain.# The first host is used as common name and must not exceed 64 characters- hosts:- test.ingress.\u0026lt;GARDENER-CLUSTER\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;GARDENER-PROJECT\u0026gt;.shoot.example.com# Certificate and private key reside in this secret.secretName:testsecret-tlsrules:- host:test.ingress.\u0026lt;GARDENER-CLUSTER\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;GARDENER-PROJECT\u0026gt;.shoot.example.comhttp:paths:- backend:serviceName:vuejs-svcservicePort:8080  Annotate the Ingress Resource\nThe annotation cert.gardener.cloud/purpose: managed instructs cert-controller-manager to handle certificate issuance for the domains found in labeled Ingress.\napiVersion:networking.k8s.io/v1beta1kind:Ingressmetadata:name:tls-example-ingressannotations:# Let Gardener manage certificates for this Ingress.cert.gardener.cloud/purpose:managed#dns.gardener.cloud/class: garden # needed on Gardener shoot clusters for managed DNS record creation (if not covered by `*.ingress.\u0026lt;GARDENER-CLUSTER\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;GARDENER-PROJECT\u0026gt;.shoot.example.com)#cert.gardener.cloud/commonname: \u0026#34;*.demo.mydomain.com\u0026#34; # optional, if not specified the first name from spec.tls[].hosts is used as common name#cert.gardener.cloud/dnsnames: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # optional, if not specified the names from spec.tls[].hosts are usedspec:tls:- hosts:- echoheaders.demo.mydomain.comsecretName:cert-echoheadersrules:- host:echoheaders.demo.mydomain.comhttp:paths:- backend:serviceName:echoheadersservicePort:80path:/The annotation cert.gardener.cloud/commonname can be set to explicitly specify the common name. If no set, the first name of spec.tls.hosts is used as common name. The annotation cert.gardener.cloud/dnsnames can be used to explicitly specify the alternative DNS names. If no set, the names of spec.tls.hosts are used.\n  Check status\nA certificate custom resource is created in the same namespace of the source cluster. You can either check the status of this certificate resource with kubectl get cert or you can check the events for the ingress with kubectl get events\nThe certificate is stored in the secret as specified in the Ingress resource.\n  Requesting a Certificate for Service If you have a service of type LoadBalancer, you can use the annotation cert.gardener.cloud/secretname together with the annotation dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames from the dns-controller-manager to trigger automatic creation of a certificate. If you wan to share a certificate between multiple services and ingresses, using the annotations cert.gardener.cloud/commonname and cert.gardener.cloud/dnsnames may be helpful.\napiVersion:v1kind:Servicemetadata:annotations:cert.gardener.cloud/secretname:test-service-secretdns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames:test-service.demo.mydomain.com#dns.gardener.cloud/class: garden # needed on Gardener shoot clusters for managed DNS record creation#cert.gardener.cloud/commonname: \u0026#34;*.demo.mydomain.com\u0026#34; # optional, if not specified the first name from dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames is used as common name#cert.gardener.cloud/dnsnames: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # optional, if specified overrides dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames annotation for certificate namesdns.gardener.cloud/ttl:\u0026#34;600\u0026#34;name:test-servicenamespace:defaultspec:ports:- name:httpport:80protocol:TCPtargetPort:8080type:LoadBalancerThe annotation cert.gardener.cloud/commonname is optional. If not specified, the first name of the annotation dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames is used as common name. It is useful to specify it explicitly, if no DNSEntry should be created for the common name by the dns-controller-manager. A typical use case is if the common name (limited to 64 characters) is set only to deal with real domain names specified with dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames which are longer than 64 characters. The annotation cert.gardener.cloud/dnsnames can be used to explicitly specify the alternative DNS names. If set, it overrides the values from the annotation dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames for the certificate (but not for creating DNS records by the dns-controller-manager).\nIf you want to share a certificate between multiple services and ingresses, using the annotations cert.gardener.cloud/commonname and cert.gardener.cloud/dnsnames may be helpful. For example, to share a wildcard certificate, you should add these two annotations\ncert.gardener.cloud/commonname:\u0026#34;*.demo.mydomain.com\u0026#34;cert.gardener.cloud/dnsnames:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;This will create or reuse a certificate for *.demo.mydomain.com.

With this project the separation of concerns between multiple clusters is realized more easily. The cert-controller-manager runs in a secured cluster where the issuer secrets are stored. At the same time it watches an untrusted source cluster and can provide certificates for it. The cert-controller-manager relies on DNS challenges (ACME only) for validating the domain names of the certificates. For this purpose it creates DNSEntry custom resources (in a possible separate dns cluster) to be handled by the compagnion dns-controller-manager from external-dns-management.\nCurrently, the cert-controller-manager supports certificate authorities via:\n Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol like Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt. Certificate Authority (CA): an existing certificate and a private key provided as a TLS Secret.  Setting up Issuers Before you can obtain certificates from a certificate authority (CA), you need to set up an issuer. The issuer is specified in the default cluster, while the certificates are specified in the source cluster.\nThe issuer custom resource contains the configuration and registration data for your account at the CA.\nAutomatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Two modes are supported:\n auto registration using an existing account  Auto registration Auto registration is mainly used for development and test environments. You only need to provide the server URL and an email address. The registration process is done automatically for you by creating a private key and performing the registration at the CA. Optionally you can provide the target secret with the privateKeySecretRef section.\nFor example see examples/20-issuer-staging.yaml:\napiVersion:cert.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Issuermetadata:name:issuer-stagingnamespace:defaultspec:acme:server:https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directoryemail:some.user@mydomain.comautoRegistration:true# with \u0026#39;autoRegistration: true\u0026#39; a new account will be created if the secretRef is not existingprivateKeySecretRef:name:issuer-staging-secretnamespace:defaultUsing existing account If you already have an existing account at the certificate authority, you need to specify email address and reference the private key from a secret.\napiVersion:v1kind:Secretmetadata:name:my-issuer-secretnamespace:defaulttype:Opaquedata:privateKey:LS0tLS1...apiVersion:cert.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Issuermetadata:name:my-issuernamespace:defaultspec:acme:server:https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directoryemail:my.account@mydomain.comprivateKeySecretRef:name:my-issuer-secretnamespace:defaultIn both cases, the state of an issuer resource can be checked on the default cluster with\n▶ kubectl get issuer NAME SERVER EMAIL STATUS TYPE AGE issuer-staging https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory some.user@mydomain.com Ready acme 8s Certificate Authority (CA) This issuer is meant to be used where a central Certificate Authority is already in place. The operator must request/provide by its own means a CA or an intermediate CA. This is mainly used for on-premises and airgapped environements.\nIt can also be used for developement or testing purproses. In this case a Self-signed Certificate Authority can be created by following the section below.\nCreate a Self-signed Certificate Authority (optional)\n▶ openssl genrsa -out CA-key.pem 4096 ▶ export CONFIG=\u0026#34; [req] distinguished_name=dn [ dn ] [ ext ] basicConstraints=CA:TRUE,pathlen:0 \u0026#34; ▶ openssl req \\  -new -nodes -x509 -config \u0026lt;(echo \u0026#34;$CONFIG\u0026#34;) -key CA-key.pem \\  -subj \u0026#34;/CN=Hello\u0026#34; -extensions ext -days 1000 -out CA-cert.pem Create a TLS secret from the certificate CA-cert.pem and the private key CA-key.pem\n▶ kubectl -n default create secret tls issuer-ca-secret \\  --cert=CA-cert.pem --key=CA-key.pem -oyaml \\  --dry-run=client \u0026gt; secret.yaml The content of the secret.yaml should look like the following, for a full example see examples/20-issuer-ca.yaml\napiVersion:v1data:tls.crt:{base64certificate}tls.key:{base64privatekey}kind:Secretmetadata:name:issuer-ca-secrettype:kubernetes.io/tlsApply the secrets in the cluster and create the issuer, for example see examples/20-issuer-ca.yaml\n---apiVersion:cert.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Issuermetadata:name:issuer-canamespace:defaultspec:ca:privateKeySecretRef:name:issuer-ca-secretnamespace:defaultThe state of the issuer resource can be checked on the default cluster with\n▶ kubectl get issuer NAME SERVER EMAIL STATUS TYPE AGE issuer-ca Ready ca 6s Some details about the CA can be found in the status of the issuer.\n▶ kubectl get issuer issuer-ca -ojsonpath=\u0026#39;{.status}\u0026#39; | jq \u0026#39;.\u0026#39; { \u0026#34;ca\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;NotAfter\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2023-05-31T14:55:55Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;NotBefore\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-09-03T14:55:55Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Subject\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;CommonName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-domain.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Country\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;DE\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Locality\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;Walldorf\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Organization\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;Gardener\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;OrganizationalUnit\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;Gardener\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;PostalCode\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;Province\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;BW\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;SerialNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1E04A2C8F057AC890F45FEC5446AE4DDA73EA1D5\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;StreetAddress\u0026#34;: null } }, \u0026#34;observedGeneration\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;requestsPerDayQuota\u0026#34;: 10000, \u0026#34;state\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Ready\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ca\u0026#34; } Requesting a Certificate To obtain a certificate for a domain, you specify a certificate custom resource on the source cluster. You can specify the issuer explicitly by reference. If there is no issuer reference, the default issuer is used (provided as command line option). You must either specify the commonName and further optional dnsNames or you can also start with a certificate signing request (CSR).\nFor domain validation, the cert-controller-manager only supports DNS challenges. For this purpose it relies on the dns-controller-manager from the external-dns-management project. If any domain name (commonName or any item from dnsNames) needs to be validated, it creates a custom resource DNSEntry in the dns cluster. When the certificate authority sees the temporary DNS record, the certificate is stored in a secret finally. The name of the secret can be specified explicitly with secretName and will be stored in the same namespace as the certificate on the source cluster.\nThe certificate is checked for renewal periodically. The renewal is performed automatically and the secret is updated. Default values for periodical check is daily, the certificate is renewed if its validity expires within 60 days.\nUsing commonName and optional dnsNames For example see examples/30-cert-simple.yaml:\napiVersion:cert.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Certificatemetadata:name:cert-simplenamespace:defaultspec:commonName:cert1.mydomain.comdnsNames:- cert1-foo.mydomain.com- cert1-bar.mydomain.com# if issuer is not specified, the default issuer is usedissuerRef:name:issuer-stagingUsing a certificate signing request (CSR) You can provide a complete CSR in PEM format (and encoded as Base64).\nFor example see examples/30-cert-csr.yaml:\napiVersion:cert.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Certificatemetadata:name:cert-csrnamespace:defaultspec:csr:LS0tLS1CRUd...issuerRef:name:issuer-staging:warning: Using a CSR is only available for ACME Issuer\nRequesting a Certificate for Ingress Add the annotation cert.gardener.cloud/purpose: managed to the Ingress resource. The cert-controller-manager will then automatically request a certificate for all domains given by the hosts in the tls section of the Ingress spec.\nFor compatibility with the Gardener Cert-Broker, you can alternatively use the deprecated label garden.sapcloud.io/purpose: managed-cert for the same outcome.\nSee also examples/40-ingress-echoheaders.yaml:\nProcess   Create the Ingress Resource (optional)\nIn order to request a certificate for a domain managed by cert-controller-manager an Ingress is required. In case you don’t already have one, take the following as an example:\napiVersion:networking.k8s.io/v1beta1kind:Ingressmetadata:name:vuejs-ingressspec:tls:# Gardener managed default domain.# The first host is used as common name and must not exceed 64 characters- hosts:- test.ingress.\u0026lt;GARDENER-CLUSTER\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;GARDENER-PROJECT\u0026gt;.shoot.example.com# Certificate and private key reside in this secret.secretName:testsecret-tlsrules:- host:test.ingress.\u0026lt;GARDENER-CLUSTER\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;GARDENER-PROJECT\u0026gt;.shoot.example.comhttp:paths:- backend:serviceName:vuejs-svcservicePort:8080  Annotate the Ingress Resource\nThe annotation cert.gardener.cloud/purpose: managed instructs cert-controller-manager to handle certificate issuance for the domains found in labeled Ingress.\napiVersion:networking.k8s.io/v1beta1kind:Ingressmetadata:name:tls-example-ingressannotations:# Let Gardener manage certificates for this Ingress.cert.gardener.cloud/purpose:managed#dns.gardener.cloud/class: garden # needed on Gardener shoot clusters for managed DNS record creation (if not covered by `*.ingress.\u0026lt;GARDENER-CLUSTER\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;GARDENER-PROJECT\u0026gt;.shoot.example.com)#cert.gardener.cloud/commonname: \u0026#34;*.demo.mydomain.com\u0026#34; # optional, if not specified the first name from spec.tls[].hosts is used as common name#cert.gardener.cloud/dnsnames: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # optional, if not specified the names from spec.tls[].hosts are usedspec:tls:- hosts:- echoheaders.demo.mydomain.comsecretName:cert-echoheadersrules:- host:echoheaders.demo.mydomain.comhttp:paths:- backend:serviceName:echoheadersservicePort:80path:/The annotation cert.gardener.cloud/commonname can be set to explicitly specify the common name. If no set, the first name of spec.tls.hosts is used as common name. The annotation cert.gardener.cloud/dnsnames can be used to explicitly specify the alternative DNS names. If no set, the names of spec.tls.hosts are used.\n  Check status\nA certificate custom resource is created in the same namespace of the source cluster. You can either check the status of this certificate resource with kubectl get cert or you can check the events for the ingress with kubectl get events\nThe certificate is stored in the secret as specified in the Ingress resource.\n  Requesting a Certificate for Service If you have a service of type LoadBalancer, you can use the annotation cert.gardener.cloud/secretname together with the annotation dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames from the dns-controller-manager to trigger automatic creation of a certificate. If you wan to share a certificate between multiple services and ingresses, using the annotations cert.gardener.cloud/commonname and cert.gardener.cloud/dnsnames may be helpful.\napiVersion:v1kind:Servicemetadata:annotations:cert.gardener.cloud/secretname:test-service-secretdns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames:test-service.demo.mydomain.com#dns.gardener.cloud/class: garden # needed on Gardener shoot clusters for managed DNS record creation#cert.gardener.cloud/commonname: \u0026#34;*.demo.mydomain.com\u0026#34; # optional, if not specified the first name from dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames is used as common name#cert.gardener.cloud/dnsnames: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # optional, if specified overrides dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames annotation for certificate namesdns.gardener.cloud/ttl:\u0026#34;600\u0026#34;name:test-servicenamespace:defaultspec:ports:- name:httpport:80protocol:TCPtargetPort:8080type:LoadBalancerThe annotation cert.gardener.cloud/commonname is optional. If not specified, the first name of the annotation dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames is used as common name. It is useful to specify it explicitly, if no DNSEntry should be created for the common name by the dns-controller-manager. A typical use case is if the common name (limited to 64 characters) is set only to deal with real domain names specified with dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames which are longer than 64 characters. The annotation cert.gardener.cloud/dnsnames can be used to explicitly specify the alternative DNS names. If set, it overrides the values from the annotation dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames for the certificate (but not for creating DNS records by the dns-controller-manager).\nIf you want to share a certificate between multiple services and ingresses, using the annotations cert.gardener.cloud/commonname and cert.gardener.cloud/dnsnames may be helpful. For example, to share a wildcard certificate, you should add these two annotations\ncert.gardener.cloud/commonname:\u0026#34;*.demo.mydomain.com\u0026#34;cert.gardener.cloud/dnsnames:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;This will create or reuse a certificate for *.demo.mydomain.com.

Conceptually, the task of the Gardener Scheduler is very similar to the task of the Kubernetes Scheduler: finding a seed for a shoot instead of a node for a pod.\nEither the scheduling strategy or the shoot cluster purpose hereby determines how the scheduler is operating. The following sections explain the configuration and flow in greater detail.\nWhy is the Gardener Scheduler needed? 1. Decoupling Previously, an admission plugin in the Gardener API server conducted the scheduling decisions. This implies changes to the API server whenever adjustments of the scheduling are needed.

Extensibility It should be possible to easily extend and tweak the scheduler in the future. Possibly, similar to the Kubernetes scheduler, hooks could be provided which influence the scheduling decisions. It should be also possible to completely replace the standard Gardener Scheduler with a custom implementation.\nAlgorithm overview The following sequence describes the steps involved to determine a seed candidate:\n Determine usable seeds with \u0026ldquo;usable\u0026rdquo; defined as follows:  no .metadata.deletionTimestamp .spec.settings.scheduling.visible is true conditions Bootstrapped, GardenletReady are true   Filter seeds:  matching .spec.seedSelector in CloudProfile used by the Shoot matching .spec.seedSelector in Shoot having no network intersection with the Shoot's networks (due to the VPN connectivity between seeds and shoots their networks must be disjoint) having .spec.settings.shootDNS.enabled=false (only if the shoot specifies a DNS domain or does not use the unmanaged DNS provider) whose taints (.spec.taints) are tolerated by the Shoot (.spec.tolerations) whose capacity for shoots would not be exceeded if the shoot is scheduled onto the seed, see Ensuring seeds capacity for shoots is not exceeded   Apply active strategy e.g., Minimal Distance strategy Choose least utilized seed, i.e., the one with the least number of shoot control planes, will be the winner and written to the .spec.seedName field of the Shoot.  Configuration The Gardener Scheduler configuration has to be supplied on startup. It is a mandatory and also the only available flag. Here is an example scheduler configuration.\nMost of the configuration options are the same as in the Gardener Controller Manager (leader election, client connection, \u0026hellip;). However, the Gardener Scheduler on the other hand does not need a TLS configuration, because there are currently no webhooks configurable.\nStrategies The scheduling strategy is defined in the candidateDeterminationStrategy of the scheduler\u0026rsquo;s configuration and can have the possible values SameRegion and MinimalDistance. The SameRegion strategy is the default strategy.\n  Same Region strategy\nThe Gardener Scheduler reads the spec.provider.type and .spec.region fields from the Shoot resource. It tries to find a seed that has the identical .spec.provider.type and .spec.provider.region fields set. If it cannot find a suitable seed, it adds an event to the shoot stating, that it is unschedulable.\n  Minimal Distance strategy\nThe Gardener Scheduler tries to find a valid seed with minimal distance to the shoot\u0026rsquo;s intended region. The distance is calculated based on the Levenshtein distance of the region. Therefore the region name is split into a base name and an orientation. Possible orientations are north, south, east, west and central. The distance then is twice the Levenshtein distance of the region\u0026rsquo;s base name plus a correction value based on the orientation and the provider.\nIf the orientations of shoot and seed candidate match, the correction value is 0, if they differ it is 2 and if either the seed\u0026rsquo;s or the shoot\u0026rsquo;s region does not have an orientation it is 1. If the provider differs the correction value is additionally incremented by 2.\nBecause of this a matching region with a matching provider is always prefered.\n  In order to put the scheduling decision into effect, the scheduler sends an update request for the Shoot resource to the API server. After validation, the Gardener Aggregated API server updates the shoot to have the spec.seedName field set. Subsequently, the Gardenlet picks up and starts to create the cluster on the specified seed.\nSpecial handling based on shoot cluster purpose  Every shoot cluster can have a purpose that describes what the cluster is used for, and also influences how the cluster is setup (see this document for more information).\nIn case the shoot has the testing purpose then the scheduler only reads the .spec.provider.type from the Shoot resource and tries to find a Seed that has the identical .spec.provider.type. The region does not matter, i.e., testing shoots may also be scheduled on a seed in a complete different region if it is better for balancing the whole Gardener system.\nseedSelector field in the Shoot specification Similar to the .spec.nodeSelector field in Pods, the Shoot specification has an optional .spec.seedSelector field. It allows the user to provide a label selector that must match the labels of Seeds in order to be scheduled to one of them. The labels on Seeds are usually controlled by Gardener administrators/operators - end users cannot add arbitrary labels themselves. If provided, the Gardener Scheduler will only consider those seeds as \u0026ldquo;suitable\u0026rdquo; whose labels match those provided in the .spec.seedSelector of the Shoot.\nBy default only seeds with the same provider than the shoot are selected. By adding a providerTypes field to the seedSelector a dedicated set of possible providers (* means all provider types) can be selected.\nEnsuring seeds capacity for shoots is not exceeded Seeds have a practical limit of how many shoots they can accommodate. Exceeding this limit is undesirable as the system performance will be noticeably impacted. Therefore, the scheduler ensures that a seed\u0026rsquo;s capacity for shoots is not exceeded by taking into account a maximum number of shoots that can be scheduled onto a seed.\nThis mechanism works as follows:\n The gardenlet is configured with certain resources and their total capacity (and, for certain resources, the amount reserved for Gardener), see /example/20-componentconfig-gardenlet.yaml. Currently, the only such resource is the maximum number of shoots that can be scheduled onto a seed. The gardenlet seed controller updates the capacity and allocatable fields in Seed status with the capacity of each resource and how much of it is actually available to be consumed by shoots. The allocatable value of a resource is equal to capacity minus reserved. When scheduling shoots, the scheduler filters out all candidate seeds whose allocatable capacity for shoots would be exceeded if the shoot is scheduled onto the seed.  Failure to determine a suitable seed In case the scheduler fails to find a suitable seed, the operation is being retried with an exponential backoff - starting with the retrySyncPeriod (default of 15s).\nCurrent Limitation / Future Plans  Azure has unfortunately a geographically non-hierarchical naming pattern and does not start with the continent. This is the reason why we will exchange the implementation of the MinimalRegion strategy with a more suitable one in the future.

Following this analogy, you can recognize components of the Gardener architecture as well-known Kubernetes components, for example, shoot clusters can be compared with pods, and seed clusters can be seen as worker nodes.\nThe following Gardener components play a similar role as the corresponding components in the Kubernetes architecture:\n   Gardener Component Kubernetes Component     gardener-apiserver kube-apiserver   gardener-controller-manager kube-controller-manager   gardener-scheduler kube-scheduler   gardenlet kubelet    Similar to how the kube-scheduler of Kubernetes finds an appropriate node for newly created pods, the gardener-scheduler of Gardener finds an appropriate seed cluster to host the control plane for newly ordered clusters. By providing multiple seed clusters for a region or provider, and distributing the workload, Gardener also reduces the blast radius of potential issues.\nKubernetes runs a primary \u0026ldquo;agent\u0026rdquo; on every node, the kubelet, which is responsible for managing pods and containers on its particular node. Decentralizing the responsibility to the kubelet has the advantage that the overall system is scalable. Gardener achieves the same for cluster management by using a gardenlet as primary \u0026ldquo;agent\u0026rdquo; on every seed cluster, and is only responsible for shoot clusters located in its particular seed cluster:\nThe gardener-controller-manager has control loops to manage resources of the Gardener API. However, instead of letting the gardener-controller-manager talk directly to seed clusters or shoot clusters, the responsibility isn’t only delegated to the gardenlet, but also managed using a reversed control flow: It\u0026rsquo;s up to the gardenlet to contact the Gardener API server, for example, to share a status for its managed seed clusters.\nReversing the control flow allows placing seed clusters or shoot clusters behind firewalls without the necessity of direct access via VPN tunnels anymore.\nTLS Bootstrapping Kubernetes doesn’t manage worker nodes itself, and it’s also not responsible for the lifecycle of the kubelet running on the workers. Similarly, Gardener doesn’t manage seed clusters itself, so Gardener is also not responsible for the lifecycle of the gardenlet running on the seeds. As a consequence, both the gardenlet and the kubelet need to prepare a trusted connection to the Gardener API server and the Kubernetes API server correspondingly.\nTo prepare a trusted connection between the gardenlet and the Gardener API server, the gardenlet initializes a bootstrapping process after you deployed it into your seed clusters:\n  The gardenlet starts up with a bootstrap kubeconfig having a bootstrap token that allows to create CertificateSigningRequest (CSR) resources.\n  After the CSR is signed, the gardenlet downloads the created client certificate, creates a new kubeconfig with it, and stores it inside a Secret in the seed cluster.\n  The gardenlet deletes the bootstrap kubeconfig secret, and starts up with its new kubeconfig.\n  The gardenlet starts normal operation.\n  The gardener-controller-manager runs a control loop that automatically signs CSRs created by gardenlets.\n The gardenlet bootstrapping process is based on the kubelet bootstrapping process. More information: Kubelet\u0026rsquo;s TLS bootstrapping.\n If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to run this bootstrap process you can create a kubeconfig pointing to the garden cluster for the gardenlet yourself, and use field gardenClientConnection.kubeconfig in the gardenlet configuration to share it with the gardenlet.\nGardenlet Certificate Rotation The certificate used to authenticate the gardenlet against the API server is valid for a year. After about 10 months, the gardenlet tries to automatically replace the current certificate with a new one (certificate rotation).\nTo use certificate rotation, you need to specify the secret to store the kubeconfig with the rotated certificate in field .gardenClientConnection.kubeconfigSecret of the gardenlet component configuration.\nRotate certificates using bootstrap kubeconfig If the gardenlet created the certificate during the initial TLS Bootstrapping using the Bootstrap kubeconfig, certificates can be rotated automatically. The same control loop in the gardener-controller-manager that signs the CSRs during the initial TLS Bootstrapping also automatically signs the CSR during a certificate rotation.\nRotate Certificate Using Custom kubeconfig When trying to rotate a custom certificate that wasn’t created by gardenlet as part of the TLS Bootstrap, the x509 certificate\u0026rsquo;s Subject field needs to conform to the following:\n the Common Name (CN) is prefixed with gardener.cloud:system:seed: the Organization (O) equals gardener.cloud:system:seeds  Otherwise, the gardener-controller-manager doesn’t automatically sign the CSR. In this case, an external component or user needs to approve the CSR manually, for example, using command kubectl certificate approve seed-csr-\u0026lt;...\u0026gt;). If that doesn’t happen within 15 minutes, the gardenlet repeats the process and creates another CSR.\nSeed Config versus Seed Selector The usage of the gardenlet is flexible:\n   Usage Description     seedConfig Run one gardenlet per seed cluster inside the seed cluster itself.   seedSelector Use one gardenlet to manage multiple seed clusters. The gardenlet can run outside of the seed cluster.     For production use it’s recommended to go for the seedConfig option, because it makes scaling easier and leads to a better distribution of responsibilities.\n   Provide a seedConfig that contains information about the seed cluster itself if you want the gardenlet in the standard way, see the example gardenlet configuration. Once bootstrapped, the gardenlet creates and updates its Seed object itself.\n  Provide a seedSelector that incorporates a label selector for the targeted seed clusters if you want the gardenlet to manage multiple seeds, see the example gardenlet configuration. In this case, you have to create the Seed objects together with a kubeconfig pointing to the cluster yourself.\n  Component Configuration In the component configuration for the gardenlet, it’s possible to define:\n settings for the Kubernetes clients interacting with the various clusters settings for the control loops inside the gardenlet settings for leader election and log levels, feature gates, and seed selection or seed configuration.  More information: Example Gardenlet Component Configuration.\nHeartbeats Similar to how Kubernetes uses Lease objects for node heart beats (see KEP), the gardenlet is using Lease objects for heart beats of the seed cluster. Every two seconds, the gardenlet checks that the seed cluster\u0026rsquo;s /healthz endpoint returns HTTP status code 200. If that is the case, the gardenlet renews the lease in the Garden cluster in the gardener-system-seed-lease namespace and updates the GardenletReady condition in the status.conditions field of the Seed resource(s).\nSimilarly to the node-lifecycle-controller inside the kube-controller-manager, the gardener-controller-manager features a seed-lifecycle-controller that sets the GardenletReady condition to Unknown in case the gardenlet fails to renew the lease. As a consequence, the gardener-scheduler doesn’t consider this seed cluster for newly created shoot clusters anymore.\n/healthz Endpoint The gardenlet includes an HTTPS server that serves a /healthz endpoint. It’s used as a liveness probe in the Deployment of the gardenlet. If the gardenlet fails to renew its lease then the endpoint returns 500 Internal Server Error, otherwise it returns 200 OK.\n ⚠️\nIn case the gardenlet is managing multiple seeds (that is, a seed selector is used) then the /healthz reports 500 Internal Server Error if there is at least one seed for which it couldn’t renew its lease. Only if it can renew the lease for all seeds it reports 200 OK.\n Please note, that the /healthz only indicates whether the gardenlet could successfully probe the Seed\u0026rsquo;s API server and renew the lease with the Garden cluster. It does not show that the Gardener extension API server (with the Gardener resource groups) is available. However, the Gardenlet is designed to withstand such connection outages and retries until the connection is reestablished.\nShooted Seeds Gardener users can use shoot clusters as seed clusters, so-called \u0026ldquo;shooted seeds\u0026rdquo;, by using shoot cluster annotation shoot.gardener.cloud/use-as-seed. By default, the gardenlet that manages this shoot cluster then automatically creates a clone of itself with the same version and the same configuration that it currently has. Then it deploys the gardenlet clone into the shooted seed cluster.\nIf you want to prevent the automatic gardenlet deployment, use the no-gardenlet value in the shoot.gardener.cloud/use-as-seed annotation. In this case, you have to deploy the gardenlet on your own into the seed cluster.\n For example, if you annotate the shoot cluster with shoot.gardener.cloud/use-as-seed=\u0026quot;true,no-gardenlet,invisible\u0026quot; the shooted seed is created without gardenlet, and the garden-scheduler ignores it (it’s invisible).\n More information: Create Shooted Seed Cluster\nMigrating from Previous Gardener Versions If your Gardener version doesn’t support gardenlets yet, no special migration is required, but the following prerequisites must be met:\n Your Gardener version is at least 0.31 before upgrading to v1. You have to make sure that your garden cluster is exposed in a way that it’s reachable from all your seed clusters.  With previous Gardener versions, you had deployed the Gardener Helm chart (incorporating the API server, controller-manager, and scheduler). With v1, this stays the same, but you now have to deploy the gardenlet Helm chart as well into all of your seeds (if they aren’t shooted, as mentioned earlier).\nMore information: Deploy a Gardenlet for all instructions.\nRelated Links Gardener Architecture\nIssue #356: Implement Gardener Scheduler\nPR #2309: Add /healthz endpoint for Gardenlet\n"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/v1.12.8/concepts/core-components/gardenlet/","title":"gardenlet","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Gardenlet Gardener is implemented using the operator pattern: It uses custom controllers that act on our own custom resources, and apply Kubernetes principles to manage clusters instead of containers.

Following the industry trend, the Schwarz Group is in the process of a digital transformation. STACKIT enables this transformation by helping to modernize the internal IT of the company branches.\nWhat is STACKIT and the STACKIT Kubernetes Engine (SKE)? STACKIT started with colocation solutions for internal and external customers in Europe-based data centers, which was then expanded to a full cloud platform stack providing an IaaS layer with VMs, storage and network, as well as a PaaS layer including Cloud Foundry and a growing set of cloud services, like databases, messaging, etc.\nWith containers and Kubernetes becoming the lingua franca of the cloud, we are happy to announce the STACKIT Kubernetes Engine (SKE), which has been released as Beta in November this year. We decided to use Gardener as the cluster management engine underneath SKE - for good reasons as you will see – and we would like to share our experiences with Gardener when working on the SKE Beta release, and serve as a testimonial for this technology.\nFigure 1: STACKIT Component Diagram Why we chose Gardener as a cluster management tool We started with the Kubernetes endeavor in the beginning of 2020 with a newly formed agile team that consisted of software engineers, highly experienced in IT operations and development. After some exploration and a short conceptual phase, we had a clear-cut opinion on how the cluster management for STACKIT should look like: we were looking for a highly customizable tool that could be adapted to the specific needs of STACKIT and the Schwarz Group, e.g. in terms of network setup or the infrastructure layer it should be running on. Moreover, the tool should be scalable to a high number of managed Kubernetes clusters and should therefore provide a fully automated operation experience. As an open source project, contributing and influencing the tool, as well as collaborating with a larger community were important aspects that motivated us. Furthermore, we aimed to offer cluster management as a self-service in combination with an excellent user experience. Our objective was to have the managed clusters come with enterprise-grade SLAs – i.e. with “batteries included”, as some say.\nWith this mission, we started our quest through the world of Kubernetes and soon found Gardener to be a hot candidate of cluster management tools that seemed to fulfill our demands. We quickly got in contact and received a warm welcome from the Gardener community. As interested potential adopter, but in the early days of the COVID-19 lockdown, we managed to organize an online workshop during which we got an introduction and deep dive into Gardener and discussed the STACKIT use cases. We learned that Gardener is extensible in many dimensions, and that contributions are always welcome and encouraged. Once we understood the basic Gardener concepts of Garden, Shoot and Seed clusters, its inception design and how this extends Kubernetes concepts in a natural way, we were eager to evaluate this tool in more detail.\nAfter this evaluation, we were convinced that this tool fulfilled all our requirements - a decision was made and off we went.\nHow Gardener was adapted and extended by SKE After becoming familiar with Gardener, we started to look into its code base to adapt it to the specific needs of the STACKIT OpenStack environment. Changes and extensions were made in order to get it integrated into the STACKIT environment, and whenever reasonable, we contributed those changes back:\n To run smoothly with the STACKIT OpenStack layer, the Gardener configuration was adapted in different places, e.g. to support CSI driver or to configure the domains of shoot API server or ingress. Gardener was extended to support shoots and shooted seeds in dual stack and dual home setup. This is used in SKE for the communication between shooted seeds and the Garden cluster. SKE uses a private image registry for Gardener installation to resolve dependencies to public image registries and to have more control over the used Gardener versions. To install and run Gardener with the private image registry, some new configurations need to be introduced into Gardener. Gardener is a first-class API based service what allowed us to smoothly integrate it into the STACKIT User Interface. We were able to jump-start and utilize also the Gardener Dashboard for our Beta release by merely adjusting the look-\u0026amp;-feel, i.e. colors, labels and icons.  Figure 2: Gardener Dashboard adapted to STACKIT UI style Experience with Gardener operations As no OpenStack installation is identical to one another, getting Gardener to run stable on the STACKIT IaaS layer revealed some operational challenges. For instance, it was challenging to find the right configuration for Cinder CSI.\nTo test for its resilience, we tried to break the managed clusters with a Chaos Monkey test, e.g. by deleting services or components needed by Kubernetes and Gardener to work properly. The reconciliation feature of Gardener fixed all those problems automatically, so that damaged Shoot clusters became operational again after a short period of time. Thus, we were not able to break Shoot clusters from an end user perspective permanently, despite our efforts. Which again speaks for Gardener’s first-class cloud native design.\nWe also participated in a fruitful community support: For several challenges we contacted the community channel and help was provided in a timely manner. A lesson learned was that raising an issue in the community early on, before getting stuck too long on your own with an unresolved problem, is essential and efficient.\nSummary Gardener is used by SKE to provide a managed Kubernetes offering for internal use cases of the Schwarz Group as well as for the public cloud offering of STACKIT. Thanks to Gardener, it was possible to get from zero to a Beta release in only about half a year’s time – this speaks for itself. Within this period, we were able to integrate Gardener into the STACKIT environment, i.e. in its OpenStack IaaS layer, its management tools and its identity provisioning solution.\nGardener has become a vital building block in STACKIT\u0026rsquo;s cloud native platform offering. For the future, the possibility to manage clusters also on other infrastructures and hyperscalers is seen as another great opportunity for extended use cases. The open co-innovation exchange with the Gardener community member companies has also opened the door to commercial co-operation.\n"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/documentation/tutorials/oidc-login/","title":"Authenticating with an Identity Provider","tags":[],"description":"Authenticating with an Identity Provider using OpenID Connect","content":"Use an identity provider to authenticate users to access shoot clusters.\nPrerequisites Please read the following background material on Authenticating.\nOverview Kubernetes on its own doesn’t provide any user management. In other words, users aren’t managed through Kubernetes resources. Whenever you refer to a human user it’s sufficient to use a unique ID, for example, an email address. Nevertheless, Gardener project owners can use an identity provider to authenticate user access for shoot clusters in the following way:\n Configure an Identity Provider using OpenID Connect (OIDC).

In other words, users aren’t managed through Kubernetes resources. Whenever you refer to a human user it’s sufficient to use a unique ID, for example, an email address. Nevertheless, Gardener project owners can use an identity provider to authenticate user access for shoot clusters in the following way:\n Configure an Identity Provider using OpenID Connect (OIDC). Configure a local kubectl oidc-login to enable oidc-login. Configure the shoot cluster to share details of the OIDC-compliant identity provider with the Kubernetes API Server. Authorize an authenticated user using role-based access control (RBAC). Verify the result   Gardener allows administrators to modify aspects of the control plane setup. It gives administrators full control of how the control plane is parameterized. While this offers much flexibility, administrators need to ensure that they don’t configure a control plane that goes beyond the service level agreements of the responsible operators team.\n Configure an Identity Provider Create a tenant in an OIDC compatible Identity Provider.

As usual, this blog post provides brief summaries for the most notable changes that we introduce with this version. Behind the scenes (and not explicitly highlighted below) we are progressing on internal code restructurings and refactorings to ease further extensions and to enhance development productivity. Speaking of those: You might be interested in watching the recording of the last Gardener Community Meeting which includes a detailed session for v2 of Terraformer, a complete rewrite in Golang and improved state handling.\nNotable Changes in v1.13 The main themes of Gardener\u0026rsquo;s v1.13 release are increments for feature gate promotions, scalability and robustness, and cleanups and refactorings. The community plans to continue on those and wants to deliver at least one more release in 2020.\nAutomatic Quotas for Gardener Resources (gardener/gardener#3072) Gardener already supports ResourceQuotas since the last release, however, it was still up to operators/administrators to create these objects in project namespaces. Obviously, in large Gardener installations with thousands of projects, this is a quite challenging task. With this release, we are shipping an improvement in the Project controller in the gardener-controller-manager that allows to automatically create ResourceQuotas based on configuration. Operators can distinguish via project label selectors which default quotas shall be defined for various projects. Please find more details here!\nResource Capacity and Reservations for Seeds (gardener/gardener#3075) The larger the Gardener landscape, the more seed cluster you require. Naturally, they have (based on constraints of the underlying infrastructure provider and/or seed cluster configuration) limits of how many shoots they can accommodate. Until this release, there were no means to prevent seed cluster from becoming overloaded (and potentially die due to this load). Now you define resource capacity and reservations in the gardenlet\u0026rsquo;s component configuration, similar to how the kubelet announces allocatable resources for Node objects. We are defaulting this to 250 shoots, but you might want to adapt this value for your own environment.\nDistributed Gardenlet Rollout for Shooted Seeds (gardener/gardener#3135) With the same motivation, i.e., to improve catering with large landscapes, we allow operators to configure distributed rollouts of gardenlets for shooted seeds. When a new Gardener version is being deployed in landscapes with a high number of shooted seeds, gardenlets of earlier versions were immediately re-deploying copies of themselves into the shooted seeds they manage. This leads to a large number of new gardenlet pods that all roughly start at the same time. Depending on the size of the landscape, this may trouble the gardener-apiservers as all of them are starting to fill their caches and create watches at the same time. By default, this rollout is now randomized within a 5m time window, i.e., it may take up to 5m until all gardenlets in all seeds have been updated.\nProgressing on Beta-Promotion for APIServerSNI Feature Gate (gardener/gardener#3082, gardener/gardener#3143) The alpha APIServerSNI feature will drastically reduce the costs for load balancers in the seed clusters, thus, it is effectively contributing to Gardener\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;minimal TCO\u0026rdquo; goal. In this release we are introducing an important improvement that optimizes the connectivity when pods talk to their control plane by avoiding an extra network hop. This is realized by a MutatingWebhookConfiguration whose server runs as a sidecar container in the kube-apiserver pod in the seed (only when the APIServerSNI feature gate is enabled). The webhook injects a KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST environment variable into pods in the shoot which prevents the additional network hop to the apiserver-proxy on all worker nodes. You can read more about it in this document.\nMore Control Plane Configurability (gardener/gardener#3141, gardener/gardener#3139) A main capability beloved by Gardener users is its openness when it comes to configurability and fine-tuning of the Kubernetes control plane components. Most managed Kubernetes offerings are not exposing options of the master components, but Gardener\u0026rsquo;s Shoot API offers a selected set of settings. With this release we are allowing to change the maximum number of (non-)mutating requests for the kube-apiserver of shoot clusters. Similarly, the grace period before deleting pods on failed nodes can now be fine-grained for the kube-controller-manager.\nImproved Project Resource Handling (gardener/gardener#3137, gardener/gardener#3136, gardener/gardener#3179) Projects are an important resource in the Gardener ecosystem as they enable collaboration with team members. A couple of improvements have landed into this release. Firstly, duplicates in the member list were not validated so far. With this release, the gardener-apiserver is automatically merging them, and in future releases requests with duplicates will be denied. Secondly, specific Projects may now be excluded from the stale checks if desired. Lastly, namespaces for Projects that were adopted (i.e., those that exist before the Project already) will now no longer deleted when the Project is being deleted. Please note that this only applies for newly created Projects.\nRemoval of Deprecated Labels and Annotations (gardener/gardener#3094) The core.gardener.cloud API group succeeded the old garden.sapcloud.io API group in the beginning of 2020, however, a lot of labels and annotations with the old API group name were still supported. We have continued with the process of removing those deprecated (but replaced with the new API group name) names. Concretely, the project labels garden.sapcloud.io/role=project and project.garden.sapcloud.io/name=\u0026lt;project-name\u0026gt; are no longer supported now. Similarly, the shoot.garden.sapcloud.io/use-as-seed and shoot.garden.sapcloud.io/ignore-alerts annotations got deleted. We are not finished yet, but we do small increments and plan to progress on the topic until we finally got rid of all artifacts with the old API group name.\nNodeLocalDNS Network Policy Rules Adapted (gardener/gardener#3184) The alpha NodeLocalDNS feature was already introduced and explained with Gardener v1.8 with the motivation to overcome certain bottlenecks with the horizontally auto-scaled CoreDNS in all shoot cluster. Unfortunately, due to a bug in the network policy rules, it was not working in all environments. We have fixed this one now, so it should be ready for further tests and investigations. Come give it a try!\nPlease bear in mind that this blog post only highlights the most noticeable changes and improvements, but there is a whole bunch more, including a ton of bug fixes in older versions!

To categorize this product, the terms \u0026ldquo;Metal-as-a-Service\u0026rdquo; (MaaS) or \u0026ldquo;bare metal cloud\u0026rdquo; are commonly used.\n One reason you stumble upon this blog post could be that you saw errors like the following in your ETCD instances:\netcd-main-0 etcd 2020-09-03 06:00:07.556157 W | etcdserver: read-only range request \u0026#34;key:\\\u0026#34;/registry/deployments/shoot--pwhhcd--devcluster2/kube-apiserver\\\u0026#34; \u0026#34; with result \u0026#34;range_response_count:1 size:9566\u0026#34; took too long (13.95374909s) to execute As it turns out, 14 seconds are way too slow for running Kubernetes API servers. It makes them go into the crash loop (leader election fails). Even worse, this whole thing is self-amplifying: The longer a response takes, the more requests queue up, leading to response times increasing further and further. The system is very unlikely to recover. 😞\nOn Github, you can easily find the reason for this problem. Most probably your disks are too slow (see etcd-io/etcd#10860). So, when you are (like in our case) on GKE and run your ETCD on their default persistent volumes, consider moving from standard disks to SSDs and the error messages should disappear. A guide on how to use SSD volumes on GKE can be found here.\nCase closed? Well. For some people it might. But when you are seeing this in your Gardener infrastructure, likely, there is something going wrong. The entire ETCD management is fully managed by the Gardener, which makes the problem a bit more interesting to look at. This blog post strives topics such as:\n Gardener operating principles Gardener architecture and ETCD management Pitfalls with multi-cloud environments Migrating GCP volumes to a new storage class  We from metal-stack learned quite a lot about the capabilities of Gardener through this problem. We are happy to share this experience with a broader audience. Gardener adopters and operators read on.\nHow Gardener Manages ETCDs In our infrastructure, we use the Gardener to provision Kubernetes clusters on bare metal machines in our own data centers using metal-stack. Even if the entire stack could be running on-premise, our initial seed cluster and the metal control plane are hosted on GKE. This way, we do not need to manage a single Kubernetes cluster in our entire landscape manually. As soon as we have Gardener deployed on this initial cluster, we can spin up further Seeds in our own data centers through the concept of shooted seeds.\nTo make this easier to understand, let us give you a simplified picture of how our Gardener production setup looks like:\nFigure 1: Simplified View on Our Production Setup For every shoot cluster, Gardener deploys an individual, standalone ETCD as a stateful set into a shoot namespace. The deployment of the ETCD stateful set is managed by a controller called etcd-druid, which reconciles a special resource of the kind etcds.druid.gardener.cloud. This Etcd resource is getting deployed during the shoot provisioning flow in the Gardenlet.\nFor failure-safety, the etcd-druid deploys the official ETCD container image along with a sidecar project called etcd-backup-restore. The sidecar automatically takes backups of the ETCD and stores them at a cloud provider, e.g. in S3 Buckets, Google Buckets, or similar. In case the ETCD comes up without or with corrupted data, the sidecar looks into the backup buckets and automatically restores the latest backup before ETCD starts up. This entire approach basically takes away the pain for operators to manually have to restore data in the event of data loss.\n We found the etcd-backup-restore project very intriguing. It was the inspiration for us to come up with a similar sidecar for the databases we use with metal-stack. This project is called backup-restore-sidecar. We can cope with postgres and rethinkdb database at the moment and more to come. Feel free to check it out when you are interested.\n As it\u0026rsquo;s the nature for multi-cloud applications to act upon a variety of cloud providers, with a single installation of Gardener, it is easily possible to spin up new Kubernetes clusters not only on GCP, but on other supported cloud platforms, too.\nWhen the Gardenlet deploys a resource like the Etcd resource into a shoot namespace, a provider-specific extension-controller has the chance to manipulate it through a mutating webhook. This way, a cloud provider can adjust the generic Gardener resource to fit his provider-specific needs. For every cloud that Gardener supports, there is such an extension-controller. For metal-stack, we also maintain one, it\u0026rsquo;s called gardener-extension-provider-metal.\n A side note for cloud providers: Meanwhile, new cloud providers can be added fully out-of-tree, i.e. without touching any of the Gardener sources. This works through API extensions and CRDs. The Gardener handles generic resources and backpacks provider-specific configuration through raw extensions. When you are a cloud provider on your own, this is really encouraging because you can integrate with Gardener without any burdens. You can find documentation on how to integrate your cloud into the Gardener here and here.\n The Mistake Is in the Deployment  This section contains code examples from Gardener v1.8.\n Now that we know how the ETCDs are managed by the Gardener, we can come back to the original problem from the beginning of this article. It turned out that the real problem was a misconfiguration in our deployment. The Gardener actually does use SSD-backed storage on GCP for ETCDs by default. During reconciliation, the gardener-extension-controller-gcp deploys a storage class called gardener.cloud-fast that enables accessing SSDs on GCP.\nBut for some reason, in our cluster we did not find such a storage class. And even more interesting, we did not use the gardener-extension-provider-gcp for any shoot reconciliation, only for ETCD backup purposes. And that was the big mistake we made: We reconciled the shoot control plane completely with gardener-extension-provider-metal even though our initial Seed actually runs on GKE and specific parts of the shoot control plane should be reconciled by the GCP extension-controller instead!\nThis is how the initial Seed resource looked like:\napiVersion: core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1 kind: Seed metadata: name: initial-seed spec: ... provider: region: gke type: metal ... ... Surprisingly, this configuration was working pretty well for a long time. The initial seed properly produced the Kubernetes control planes of our shooted seeds that looked like this:\n$ kubectl get controlplanes.extensions.gardener.cloud NAME TYPE PURPOSE STATUS AGE fra-equ01 metal Succeeded 85d fra-equ01-exposure metal exposure Succeeded 85d And this is another interesting observation: There are two ControlPlane resources. One regular resource and one with an exposure purpose. Gardener distinguishes between two types for this exact reason: Environments where the shoot control plane runs on a different cloud provider than the Kubernetes worker nodes. The regular ControlPlane resource gets reconciled by the provider configured in the Shoot resource, the exposure type ControlPlane by the provider configured in the Seed resource.\nWith the existing configuration the gardener-extension-provider-gcp does not kick in and hence, it neither deploys the gardener.cloud-fast storage class nor does it mutate the Etcd resource to point to it. And in the end, we are left with ETCD volumes using the default storage class (which is what we do for ETCD stateful sets in the metal-stack seeds, because our default storage class uses csi-lvm that writes into logical volumes on the SSD disks in our physical servers).\nThe correction we had to make was a one-liner: Setting the provider type of the initial Seed resource to gcp.\n$ kubectl get seed initial-seed -o yaml apiVersion: core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1 kind: Seed metadata: name: initial-seed spec: ... provider: region: gke type: gcp # \u0026lt;-- here ... ... This change moved over the control plane exposure reconciliation to the gardener-extension-provider-gcp:\n$ kubectl get -n \u0026lt;shoot-namespace\u0026gt; controlplanes.extensions.gardener.cloud NAME TYPE PURPOSE STATUS AGE fra-equ01 metal Succeeded 85d fra-equ01-exposure gcp exposure Succeeded 85d And boom, after some time of waiting for all sorts of magic reconciliations taking place in the background, the missing storage class suddenly appeared:\n$ kubectl get sc NAME PROVISIONER gardener.cloud-fast kubernetes.io/gce-pd standard (default) kubernetes.io/gce-pd Also, the Etcd resource was now configured properly to point to the new storage class:\n$ kubectl get -n \u0026lt;shoot-namespace\u0026gt; etcd etcd-main -o yaml apiVersion: druid.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1 kind: Etcd metadata: ... name: etcd-main spec: ... storageClass: gardener.cloud-fast # \u0026lt;-- was pointing to default storage class before! volumeClaimTemplate: main-etcd ...  Only the etcd-main storage class gets changed to gardener.cloud-fast. The etcd-events configuration will still point to standard disk storage because this ETCD is much less occupied as compared to the etcd-main stateful set.\n The Migration Now that the deployment was in place such that this mistake would not repeat in the future, we still had the ETCDs running on the default storage class. The reconciliation does not delete the existing persistent volumes (PVs) on its own.\nTo bring production back up quickly, we temporarily moved the ETCD pods to other nodes in the GKE cluster. These were nodes which were less occupied, such that the disk throughput was a little higher than before. But surely that was not a final solution.\nFor a proper solution we had to move the ETCD data out of the standard disk PV into a SSD-based PV.\nEven though we had the etcd-backup-restore sidecar, we did not want to fully rely on the restore mechanism to do the migration. The backup should only be there for emergency situations when something goes wrong. Thus, we came up with another approach to introduce the SSD volume: GCP disk snapshots. This is how we did the migration:\n Scale down etcd-druid to zero in order to prevent it from disturbing your migration Scale down the kube-apiservers deployment to zero, then wait for the ETCD stateful to take another clean snapshot Scale down the ETCD stateful set to zero as well (in order to prevent Gardener from trying to bring up the downscaled resources, we used small shell constructs like while true; do kubectl scale deploy etcd-druid --replicas 0 -n garden; sleep 1; done) Take a drive snapshot in GCP from the volume that is referenced by the ETCD PVC Create a new disk in GCP from the snapshot on a SSD disk Delete the existing PVC and PV of the ETCD (oops, data is now gone!) Manually deploy a PV into your Kubernetes cluster that references this new SSD disk Manually deploy a PVC with the name of the original PVC and let it reference the PV that you have just created Scale up the ETCD stateful set and check that ETCD is running properly (if something went terribly wrong, you still have the backup from the etcd-backup-restore sidecar, delete the PVC and PV again and let the sidecar bring up ETCD instead) Scale up the kube-apiserver deployment again Scale up etcd-druid again (stop your shell hacks ;D)  This approach worked very well for us and we were able to fix our production deployment issue. And what happened: We have never seen any crashing kube-apiservers again. 🎉\nConclusion As bad as problems in production are, they are the best way for learning from your mistakes. For new users of the Gardener it can be pretty overwhelming to understand the rich configuration possibilities that the Gardener brings. However, once you get a hang of how the Gardener works, the application offers an exceptional versatility that makes it very much suitable for production use-cases like ours.\nThis example has shown how Gardener:\n Can handle arbitrary layers of infrastructure hosted by different cloud providers. Allows provider-specific tweaks to gain ideal performance for every cloud you want to support. Leverages Kubernetes core principles across the entire project architecture, making it vastly extensible and resilient. Brings useful disaster recovery mechanisms to your infrastructure (e.g. with etcd-backup-restore).  We hope that you could take away something new through this blog post. With this article we also want to thank the SAP Gardener team for helping us to integrate Gardener with metal-stack. It\u0026rsquo;s been a great experience so far. 😄 😍\n"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/documentation/guides/administer_shoots/hibernate-cluster/","title":"Hibernate a Cluster","tags":["task"],"description":"","content":"Clusters are only needed 24 hours a day if they run productive workload. So whenever you do development in a cluster, or just use it for tests or demo purposes, you can save much money if you scale-down your Kubernetes resources whenever you don\u0026rsquo;t need them. However, scaling them down manually can become time-consuming the more resources you have.\nGardener offers a clever way to automatically scale-down all resources to zero: cluster hibernation. You can either hibernate a cluster by pushing a button or by defining a hibernation schedule.\n To save costs, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to define a hibernation schedule before the creation of a cluster. You can hibernate your cluster or wake up your cluster manually even if there\u0026rsquo;s a schedule for its hibernation.\n  What is hibernated? What isn’t affected by the hibernation? Hibernate your cluster manually Wake up your cluster manually Create a schedule to hibernate your cluster  What is hibernated? When a cluster is hibernated, Gardener scales down worker nodes and deletes the cluster\u0026rsquo;s control plane to free resources at the IaaS provider. This affects:\n Your workload, for example, pods, deployments, custom resources. The virtual machines running your workload. The resources of the control plane of your cluster.  What isn’t affected by the hibernation? To scale up everything where it was before hibernation, Gardener doesn’t delete state-related information, that is, information stored in persistent volumes. The cluster state as persistent in etcd is also preserved.\nHibernate your cluster manually   On the Gardener dashboard, choose CLUSTERS \u0026gt; [YOUR-CLUSTER] \u0026gt; OVERVIEW \u0026gt; Lifecycle \u0026gt; Hibernation \u0026gt; Hibernate Cluster.\n  To confirm the hibernation, enter the name of your cluster and choose HIBERNATE.\n   You can also hibernate your cluster by setting spec.hibernation.enabled to true in the cluster\u0026rsquo;s YAML file.

Control plane migration, load balancer consolidation, new security features are just a few topics we progressed with. As always, a detailed list of features, improvements, and bug fixes can be found in the release notes of each release. If you are going to update from a previous Gardener version, please take your time to go through the action items in the release notes.\nNotable Changes in v1.12 Release v1.12, fresh from the oven, is shipped with plenty of improvements, features and some API changes we want to pick up in the next sections.\nDrop Functionless DNS Providers (gardener/gardener#3036) This release drops the support for so-called functionless DNS providers. Those are providers in a shoot’s specification (.spec.dns.providers) which don’t serve the shoot’s domain (.spec.dns.domain), but are created by Gardener in the seed cluster to serve DNS requests coming from the shoot cluster. If such providers don’t specify a type or secretName the creation or update request for the corresponding shoot is denied.\nSeed Taints (gardener/gardener#2955) In an earlier release, we reserved a dedicated section in seed.spec.settings as a replacement for disable-capacity-reservation, disable-dns, invisible taints. These already deprecated taints were still considered and synced, which gave operators enough time to switch their integration to the new settings field. As of version v1.12, support for them has been discontinued and they are automatically removed from seed objects. You may use the actual taint names in a future release of Gardener again.\nLoad Balancer Events During Shoot Reconciliation (gardener/gardener#3028) As Gardener is capable of managing thousands of clusters, it is crucial to keep operation efforts at a minimum. This release demonstrates this endeavor by further improving error reporting to the end user. During a shoot’s reconciliation, Gardener creates Services of type LoadBalancer in the shoot cluster, e.g. for VPN or Nginx-Ingress addon, and waits for a successful creation. However, in the past we experienced that occurring issues caused by the party creating the load balancer (typically Cloud-Controller-Manager) are only exposed in the logs or as events. Gardener now fetches these event messages and propagates them to the shoot status in case of a failure. Users can then often fix the problem themselves, if for example the failure discloses an exhausted quota on the cloud provider.\nKonnectivityTunnel Feature Per Shoot(gardener/gardener#3007) Since release v1.6 Gardener has been capable of reversing the tunnel direction from the seed to the shoot via the KonnectivityTunnel feature gate (more information). With this release we make it possible to control the feature per shoot. We recommend to selectively enable the KonnectivityTunnel, as it is still in alpha state.\nReference Protection (gardener/gardener#2771, gardener/gardener 1708419) Shoot clusters may refer to external objects, like Secrets for specified DNS providers or they have a reference to an audit policy ConfigMap. Deleting those objects while any shoot still references them causes sever errors, often only recoverable by an immense amount of manual operations effort. To prevent such scenarios, Gardener now adds a new finalizer gardener.cloud/reference-protection to these objects and removes it as soon as the object itself becomes releasable. Due to compatibility reasons, we decided that the handling for audit policy ConfigMaps is delivered as an opt-in feature first, so please familiarize yourself with the necessary settings in the Gardener Controller Manager component config if you already plan to enable it.\nSupport For Resource Quotas (gardener/gardener#2627) After the Kubernetes upstream change (kubernetes/kubernetes#93537) for externalizing the backing admission plugin has been accepted, we are happy to announce the support of ResourceQuotas for Gardener offered resource kinds. ResourceQuotas allow you to specify a maximum number of objects per namespace, especially for end-user objects like Shoots or SecretBindings in a project namespace. Even though the admission plugin is enabled by default in the Gardener API Server, make sure the Kube Controller Manager runs the resourcequota controller as well.\nWatch Out Developers, Terraformer v2 Is Coming! (gardener/gardener#3034) Although not only related to Gardener core, but still an important milestone to mention, is the preparation towards Terraformer v2 in the extensions library. With Terraformer v2, Gardener extensions using Terraform scripts will benefit from great consistency improvements. Please check out #3034) which demonstrates necessary steps to transition to Terraformer v2 as soon as it’s been released.\nNotable Changes in v1.11 The Gardener community worked eagerly to deliver plenty of improvements with version v1.11. Those help us to further progress with topics like control plane migration, which is actively being worked on, or to harden our load balancer consolidation (APIServerSNI) feature. Besides improvements and fixes (full list available in release notes), this release as well contains major features and we don’t want to miss a chance to walk you through them.\nGardener Admission Controller (gardener/gardener#2832), (gardener/gardener#2781) In this release, all admission related HTTP handlers moved from the Gardener Controller Manager (GCM) to the new component Gardener Admission Controller. The admission controller is rather a small component as opposed to GCM with regards to memory footprint and CPU consumption, and thus allows you to run multiple replicas of it much cheaper than it was before. We certainly recommend specifying the admission controller deployment with more than one replica, since it reduces the odds of a system-wide outage and increases the performance of your Gardener service.\nBesides the already known Namespace and Kubeconfig Secret validation, a new admission handler Resource-Size-Validator was added to the admission controller. It allows operators to restrict the size for all kinds of Kubernetes objects, especially sent by end-users to the Kubernetes or Gardener API Server. We address a security concern with this feature to prevent denial of service attacks in which an attacker artificially increases the size of objects to exhaust your object store, API server caches, or to let Gardener and Kubernetes controllers run out-of-memory. The documentation reveals an approach of finding the right resource size for your setup and why you should create exceptions for technical users and operators.\nDeferring Shoot Progress Reporting (gardener/gardener#2909), Shoot progress reporting is the continuous update process of a shoot’s .status.lastOperation field while the shoot is being reconciled by Gardener. Many steps are involved during reconciliation and depending on the size of your setup, the updates might become an issue for the Gardener API Server which will refrain to process further requests for a certain period. With .controllers.shoot.progressReportPeriod in Gardenlet’s component configuration, you can now delay these updates for the specified period.\nNew Policy For Controller Registrations (gardener/gardener#2896), A while ago, we added support for different policies in ControllerRegistrations which determine under which circumstances the deployments of registration controllers happen in affected seed clusters. If you specify the new policy AlwaysExceptNoShoots, the respective extension controller will be deployed to all seed cluster hosting at least one shoot cluster. After all shoot clusters from a seed are gone, the extension deployment will be deleted again. A full list of supported policies can be found here.\n"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/blog/2020-10/00/","title":"Gardener Integrates with KubeVirt","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The Gardener team is happy to announce that Gardener now offers support for an additional, often requested, infrastructure/virtualization technology, namely KubeVirt! Gardener can now provide Kubernetes-conformant clusters using KubeVirt managed Virtual Machines in the environment of your choice. This integration has been tested and works with any qualified Kubernetes (provider) cluster that is compatibly configured to host the required KubeVirt components, in particular for example Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization.\nGardener enables Kubernetes consumers to centralize and operate efficiently homogenous Kubernetes clusters across different IaaS providers and even private environments. This way the same cloud-based application version can be hosted and operated by its vendor or consumer on a variety of infrastructures. When a new customer or your development team demands for a new infrastructure provider, Gardener helps you to quickly and easily on-board your workload. Furthermore, on this new infrastructure, Gardener keeps the seamless Kubernetes management experience for your Kubernetes operators, while upholding the consistency of the CI/CD pipeline of your software development team.\nArchitecture and Workflow Gardener is based on the idea of three types of clusters – Garden cluster, Seed cluster and Shoot cluster (see Figure 1). The Garden cluster is used to control the entire Kubernetes environment centrally in a highly scalable design. The highly available seed clusters are used to host the end users (shoot) clusters’ control planes. Finally, the shoot clusters consist only of worker nodes to host the cloud native applications.\nFigure 1: Gardener Architecture An integration of the Gardener open source project with a new cloud provider follows a standard Gardener extensibility approach. The integration requires two new components: a provider extension and a Machine Controller Manager (MCM) extension. Both components together enable Gardener to instruct the new cloud provider. They run in the Gardener seed clusters that host the control planes of the shoots based on that cloud provider. The role of the provider extension is to manage the provider-specific aspects of the shoot clusters’ lifecycle, including infrastructure, control plane, worker nodes, and others. It works in cooperation with the MCM extension, which in particular is responsible to handle machines that are provisioned as worker nodes for the shoot clusters. To get this job done, the MCM extension leverages the VM management/API capabilities available with the respective cloud provider.\nSetting up a Kubernetes cluster always involves a flow of interdependent steps (see Figure 2), beginning with the generation of certificates and preparation of the infrastructure, continuing with the provisioning of the control plane and the worker nodes, and ending with the deployment of system components. Gardener can be configured to utilize the KubeVirt extensions in its generic workflow at the right extension points, and deliver the desired outcome of a KubeVirt backed cluster.\nFigure 2: Generic cluster reconciliation flow with extension points Gardener Integration with KubeVirt in Detail Integration with KubeVirt follows the Gardener extensibility concept and introduces the two new components mentioned above: the KubeVirt Provider Extension and the KubeVirt Machine Controller Manager (MCM) Extension.\nFigure 3: Gardener integration with KubeVirt The KubeVirt Provider Extension consists of three separate controllers that handle respectively the infrastructure, the control plane, and the worker nodes of the shoot cluster.\nThe Infrastructure Controller configures the network communication between the shoot worker nodes. By default, shoot worker nodes only use the provider cluster’s pod network. To achieve higher level of network isolation and better performance, it is possible to add more networks and replace the default pod network with a different network using container network interface (CNI) plugins available in the provider cluster. This is currently based on Multus CNI and NetworkAttachmentDefinitions.\nExample infrastructure configuration in a shoot definition:\nprovider:type:kubevirtinfrastructureConfig:apiVersion:kubevirt.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:InfrastructureConfignetworks:tenantNetworks:- name:network-1config:| {\u0026#34;cniVersion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0.4.0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;bridge-firewall\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;plugins\u0026#34;: [{\u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;bridge\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;isGateway\u0026#34;: true,\u0026#34;isDefaultGateway\u0026#34;: true,\u0026#34;ipMasq\u0026#34;: true,\u0026#34;ipam\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;host-local\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;subnet\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;10.100.0.0/16\u0026#34;}},{\u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;firewall\u0026#34;}]}default:trueThe Control Plane Controller deploys a Cloud Controller Manager (CCM). This is a Kubernetes control plane component that embeds cloud-specific control logic. As any other CCM, it runs the Node controller that is responsible for initializing Node objects, annotating and labeling them with cloud-specific information, obtaining the node’s hostname and IP addresses, and verifying the node’s health. It also runs the Service controller that is responsible for setting up load balancers and other infrastructure components for Service resources that require them.\nFinally, the Worker Controller is responsible for managing the worker nodes of the Gardener shoot clusters.\nExample worker configuration in a shoot definition:\nprovider:type:kubevirtworkers:- name:cpu-workerminimum:1maximum:2machine:type:standard-1image:name:ubuntuversion:\u0026#34;18.04\u0026#34;volume:type:defaultsize:20Gizones:- europe-west1-cFor more information about configuring the KubeVirt Provider Extension as an end-user, see Using the KubeVirt provider extension with Gardener as end-user.\nEnabling Your Gardener Setup to Leverage a KubeVirt Compatible Environment The very first step required is to define the machine types (VM types) for VMs that will be available. This is achieved via the CloudProfile custom resource. The machine types configuration includes details such as CPU, GPU, memory, OS image, and more.\nExample CloudProfile custom resource:\napiVersion:core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1kind:CloudProfilemetadata:name:kubevirtspec:type:kubevirtproviderConfig:apiVersion:kubevirt.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:CloudProfileConfigmachineImages:- name:ubuntuversions:- version:\u0026#34;18.04\u0026#34;sourceURL:\u0026#34;https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/bionic/current/bionic-server-cloudimg-amd64.img\u0026#34;kubernetes:versions:- version:\u0026#34;1.18.5\u0026#34;machineImages:- name:ubuntuversions:- version:\u0026#34;18.04\u0026#34;machineTypes:- name:standard-1cpu:\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;gpu:\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;memory:4GivolumeTypes:- name:defaultclass:defaultregions:- name:europe-west1zones:- name:europe-west1-b- name:europe-west1-c- name:europe-west1-dOnce a machine type is defined, it can be referenced in shoot definitions. This information is used by the KubeVirt Provider Extension to generate MachineDeployment and MachineClass custom resources required by the KubeVirt MCM extension for managing the worker nodes of the shoot clusters during the reconciliation process.\nFor more information about configuring the KubeVirt Provider Extension as an operator, see Using the KubeVirt provider extension with Gardener as operator.\nKubeVirt Machine Controller Manager (MCM) Extension The KubeVirt MCM Extension is responsible for managing the VMs that are used as worker nodes of the Gardener shoot clusters using the virtualization capabilities of KubeVirt. This extension handles all necessary lifecycle management activities, such as machines creation, fetching, updating, listing, and deletion.\nThe KubeVirt MCM Extension implements the Gardener’s common driver interface for managing VMs in different cloud providers. As already mentioned, the KubeVirt MCM Extension is using the MachineDeployments and MachineClasses – an abstraction layer that follows the Kubernetes native declarative approach - to get instructions from the KubeVirt Provider Extension about the required machines for the shoot worker nodes. Also, the cluster austoscaler integrates with the scale subresource of the MachineDeployment resource. This way, Gardener offers a homogeneous autoscaling experience across all supported providers.\nWhen a new shoot cluster is created or when a new worker node is needed for an existing shoot cluster, a new Machine will be created, and at that time, the KubeVirt MCM extension will create a new KubeVirt VirtualMachine in the provider cluster. This VirtualMachine will be created based on a set of configurations in the MachineClass that follows the specification of the KubeVirt provider.\nThe KubeVirt MCM Extension has two main components. The MachinePlugin is responsible for handling the machine objects, and the PluginSPI is in charge of making calls to the cloud provider interface, to manage its resources.\nFigure 4: KubeVirt MCM extension workflow and architecture As shown in Figure 4, the MachinePlugin receives a machine request from the MCM and starts its processing by decoding the request, doing partial validation, extracting the relevant information, and sending it to the PluginSPI.\nThe PluginSPI then creates, gets, or deletes VirtualMachines depending on the method called by the MachinePlugin. It extracts the kubeconfig of the provider cluster and handles all other required KubeVirt resources such as the secret that holds the cloud-init configurations, and DataVolumes that are mounted as disks to the VMs.\nSupported Environments The Gardener KubeVirt support is currently qualified on:\n KubeVirt v0.32.0 (and later) Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.4 (and later)  There are also plans for further improvements and new features, for example integration with CSI drivers for storage management. Details about the implementation progress can be found in the Gardener project on GitHub.\nYou can find further resources about the open source project Gardener at https://gardener.cloud.\n"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/blog/2020-10/01/","title":"Shoot Reconciliation Details","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Do you want to understand how Gardener creates and updates Kubernetes clusters (Shoots)? Well, it\u0026rsquo;s complicated, but if you are not afraid of large diagrams and are a visual learner like me, this might be useful to you.\nIntroduction In this blog post I will share a technical diagram which attempts to tie together the various components involved when Gardener creates a Kubernetes cluster. I have created and curated the diagram, which visualizes the Shoot reconciliation flow since I started developing on Gardener. Aside from serving as a memory aid for myself, I created it in hopes that it may potentially help contributors to understand a core piece of the complex Gardener machinery. Please be advised that the diagram and components involved are large. Although it can be easily divided into multiple diagrams, I want to show all the components and connections in a single diagram to create an overview of the reconciliation flow.\nThe goal is to visualize the interactions of the components involved in the Shoot creation. It is not intended to serve as a documentation of every component involved.\nBackground Taking a step back, the Gardener READ.me states\n In essence, Gardener is an extension API server that comes along with a bundle of custom controllers. It introduces new API objects in an existing Kubernetes cluster (which is called garden cluster) in order to use them for the management of end-user Kubernetes clusters (which are called shoot clusters). These shoot clusters are described via declarative cluster specifications which are observed by the controllers. They will bring up the clusters, reconcile their state, perform automated updates and make sure they are always up and running.\n This means that Gardener, just like any Kubernetes controller, creates Kubernetes clusters (Shoots) using a reconciliation loop.\nThe Gardenlet contains the controller and reconciliation loop responsible for the creation, update, deletion and migration of Shoot cluster (there are more, but we spare them in this article). In addition, the Gardener Controller Manager also reconciles Shoot resources, but only for seed-independent functionality such as Shoot hibernation, Shoot maintenance or quota control.\nThis blog post is about the reconciliation loop in the Gardenlet responsible for creating and updating Shoot clusters. The code can be found here. The reconciliation loops of the extension controllers can be found in their individual repositories.\nShoot reconciliation flow diagram When Gardner creates a Shoot cluster, there are three conceptual layers involved: the Garden cluster, the Seed cluster and the Shoot cluster. Each layer represents a top-level section in the diagram (similar to a lane in a BPMN diagram).\nIt might seem confusing, that the Shoot cluster itself is a layer, because the whole flow in the first place is about creating the Shoot cluster. I decided to introduce this separate layer to make a clear distinction between which resources exist in the Seed API server (managed by Gardener) and which in the Shoot API server (accessible by the Shoot owner).\nEach section contains several components. Components are mostly Kubernetes resources in a Gardener installation (e.g. the gardenlet deployment in the Seed cluster).\nThis is the list of components:\n(Virtual) Garden Cluster\n Gardener Extension API server Validating Provider Webhooks Project Namespace  Seed Cluster\n Gardenlet Seed API server  every Shoot Control Plane has a dedicated namespace in the Seed.   Cloud Provider (owned by Stakeholder).  Arguably part of the Shoot cluster but used by components in the Seed cluster to create the infrastructure for the Shoot.

How to use the diagram The diagram\n should be read from top to bottom - starting in the top left corner with the creation of the Shoot resource via the Gardener Extension API server. should not require an encompassing documentation / description. More detailed documentation on the components itself, can usually be found in the respective repository. does not show which activities execute in parallel (many) and also does not describe the exact dependencies between the steps. This can be found out by looking at the source code. It however tries to put the activities in a logical order of executing during the reconciliation flow.  Occasionally, there is an info box with additional information next to parts in the diagram that in my point of view require further explanation. Large example resource for the Gardener CRDs (e.g Worker CRD, Infrastructure CRD) are placed on the left side and are referenced by a dotted line (\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash;).\nBe aware, that Gardener is an evolving project, so the diagram will most likely be already outdated by the time you are reading this. Nevertheless, it should give a solid starting point for further explorations into the details of Gardener.\nFlow diagram The diagram can be found below and on Github.com.

Despite being limited in capacity these days, we were able to reach some major milestones, like adding Kubernetes v1.19 support and the long-delayed automated gardenlet certificate rotation. Whilst we continue to work on topics related to scalability, robustness, and better observability, we agreed to adjust our focus a little more into the areas of development productivity, code quality and unit/integration testing for the upcoming releases.\nNotable Changes in v1.10 Gardener v1.10 was a comparatively small release (measured by the number of changes) but it comes with some major features!\nKubernetes 1.19 support (gardener/gardener#2799) The newest minor release of Kubernetes is now supported by Gardener (and all the maintained provider extensions)! Predominantly, we have enabled CSI migration for OpenStack now that it got promoted to beta, i.e. 1.19 shoots will no longer use the in-tree Cinder volume provisioner. The CSI migration enablement for Azure got postponed (to at least 1.20) due to some issues that the Kubernetes community is trying to fix in the 1.20 release cycle. As usual, the 1.19 release notes should be considered before upgrading your shoot clusters.\nAutomated certificate rotation for gardenlet (gardener/gardener#2542) Similar to the kubelet, the gardenlet supports TLS bootstrapping when deployed into a new seed cluster. It will request a client certificate for the garden cluster using the CertificateSigningRequest API of Kubernetes and store the generated results in a Secret object in the garden namespace of its seed. These certificates are usually valid for one year. We have now added support for automatic renewals if the expiration dates are approaching.\nImproved monitoring alerts (gardener/gardener#2776) We have worked on a larger refactoring to improve reliability and accuracy of our monitoring alerts for both shoot control planes in the seed as well as shoot system components running on worker nodes. The improvements are primarily for operators and should result in less false positive alerts. Also, the alerts should fire less frequently and are better grouped in order to reduce to overall amount of alerts.\nSeed deletion protection (gardener/gardener#2732) Our validation to improve robustness and countermeasures against accidental mistakes has been improved. Earlier, it was possible to remove the use-as-seed annotation for shooted seeds or directly set the deletionTimestamp on Seed objects, despite of the fact that they might still run shoot control planes. Seed deletion would not start in these cases, although, it would disrupt the system unnecessarily, and result in some unexpected behaviour. The Gardener API server is now forbidding such requests if the seeds are not completely empty yet.\nLogging improvements for Loki (multiple PRs) After we released our large logging stack refactoring (from EFK to Loki) with Gardener v1.8, we have continued to work on reliability, quality and user feedback in general. We aren\u0026rsquo;t done yet, though, Gardener v1.10 includes a bunch of improvements which will help to graduate the Logging feature gate to beta and GA, eventually.\nNotable Changes in v1.9 The v1.9 release contained tons of small improvements and adjustments in various areas of the code base and a little less new major features. However, we don\u0026rsquo;t want to miss the opportunity to highlight a few of them.\nCRI validation in CloudProfiles (gardener/gardener#2137) A couple of releases back we have introduced support for containerd and the ContainerRuntime extension API. The supported container runtimes are operating system specific, and until now it wasn\u0026rsquo;t possible for end-users to easily figure out whether they can enable containerd or other ContainerRuntime extensions for their shoots. With this change, Gardener administrators/operators can now provide that information in the .spec.machineImages section in the CloudProfile resource. This also allows for enhanced validation and prevents misconfigurations.\nNew shoot event controller (gardener/gardener#2649) The shoot controllers in both the gardener-controller-manager and gardenlet fire several Events for some important operations (e.g., automated hibernation/wake-up due to hibernation schedule, automated Kubernetes/machine image version update during maintenance, etc.). Earlier, the only way to prolong the lifetime of these events was to modify the --event-ttl command line parameter of the garden cluster\u0026rsquo;s kube-apiserver. This came with the disadvantage that all events were kept for a longer time (not only those related to Shoots that an operator is usually interested in and ideally wants to store for a couple of days). The new shoot event controller allows to achieve this by deleting non-shoot events. This helps operators and end-users to better understand which changes were applied to their shoots by Gardener.\nEarly deployment of the logging stack for new shoots (gardener/gardener#2750) Since the first introduction of the Logging feature gate two years back the logging stack was only deployed at the very end of the shoot creation. This had the disadvantage that control plane pod logs were not kept in case the shoot creation flow is interrupted before the logging stack could be deployed. In some situations, this was preventing fetching relevant information about why a certain control plane component crashed. We now deploy the logging stack very early in the shoot creation flow to always have access to such information.\n"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/blog/2020-08/00/","title":"Gardener v1.8.0 Released","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Even if we are in the midst of the summer holidays, a new Gardener release came out yesterday: v1.8.0! It\u0026rsquo;s main themes are the large change of our logging stack to Loki (which was already explained in detail on a blog post on grafana.com), more configuration options to optimize the utilization of a shoot, node-local DNS, new project roles, and significant improvements for the Kubernetes client that Gardener uses to interact with the many different clusters.\nNotable Changes Logging 2.0: EFK stack replaced by Loki (gardener/gardener#2515) Since two years or so Gardener could optionally provision a dedicated logging stack per seed and per shoot which was based on fluent-bit, fluentd, ElasticSearch and Kibana. This feature was still hidden behind an alpha-level feature gate and never got promoted to beta so far. Due to various limitations of this solution we decided to replace the EFK stack with Loki. As we already have Prometheus and Grafana deployments for both users and operators by default for all clusters the choice was just natural. Please find out more on this topic at this dedicated blog post.\nCluster identities and DNSOwner objects (gardener/gardener#2471, gardener/gardener#2576) The shoot control plane migration topic is ongoing since a few months already, and we are very much progressing with it. A first alpha version will probably make it out soon. As part of these endeavors, we introduced cluster identities and the usage of DNSOwner objects in this release. Both are needed to gracefully migrate the DNSEntry extension objects from the old seed to the new seed as part of the control plane migration process. Please find out more on this topic at this blog post.\nNew uam role for Project members to limit user access management privileges (gardener/gardener#2611) In order to allow external user access management system to integrate with Gardener and to fulfil certain compliance aspects, we have introduced a new role called uam for Project members (next to admin and viewer). Only if a user has this role then he/she is allowed to add/remove other human users to the respective Project. By default, all newly created Projects assign this role only to the owner while, for backwards-compatibility reasons, it will be assigned for all members for existing projects. Project owners can steadily revoke this access as desired. Interestingly, the uam role is backed by a custom RBAC verb called manage-members, i.e., the Gardener API server is only admitting changes to the human Project members if the respective user is bound to this RBAC verb.\nNew node-local DNS feature for shoots (gardener/gardener#2528) By default, we are using CoreDNS as DNS plugin in shoot clusters which we auto-scale horizontally using HPA. However, in some situations we are discovering certain bottlenecks with it, e.g., unreliable UDP connections, unnecessary node hopping, inefficient load balancing, etc. To further optimize the DNS performance for shoot clusters, it is now possible to enable a new alpha-level feature gate in the gardenlet\u0026rsquo;s componentconfig: NodeLocalDNS. If enabled, all shoots will get a new DaemonSet to run a DNS server on each node.\nMore kubelet and API server configurability (gardener/gardener#2574, gardener/gardener#2668) One large benefit of Gardener is that it allows you to optimize the usage of your control plane as well as worker nodes by exposing relevant configuration parameters in the Shoot API. In this version, we are adding support to configure kubelet\u0026rsquo;s values for systemReserved and kubeReserved resources as well as the kube-apiserver\u0026rsquo;s watch cache sizes. This allows end-users to get to better node utilization and/or performance for their shoot clusters.\nConfigurable timeout settings for machine-controller-manager (gardener/gardener#2563) One very central component in Project Gardener is the machine-controller-manager for managing the worker nodes of shoot clusters. It has extensive qualities with respect to node lifecycle management and rolling updates. As such, it uses certain timeout values, e.g. when creating or draining nodes, or when checking their health. Earlier, those were not customizable by end-users, but we are adding this possibility now. You can fine-grain these settings per worker pool in the Shoot API such that you can optimize the lifecycle management of your worker nodes even more!\nImproved usage of cached client to reduce network I/O (gardener/gardener#2635, gardener/gardener#2637) In the last Gardener release v1.7 we have introduced a huge refactoring the clients that we use to interact with the many different Kubernetes clusters. This is to further optimize the network I/O performed by leveraging watches and caches as good as possible. It\u0026rsquo;s still an alpha-level feature that must be explicitly enabled in the Gardenlet\u0026rsquo;s component configuration, though, with this release we have improved certain things in order to pave the way for beta promotion. For example, we were initially also using a cached client when interacting with shoots. However, as the gardenlet runs in the seed as well (and thus can communicate cluster-internally with the kube-apiservers of the respective shoots) this cache is not necessary and just memory overhead. We have removed it again and saw the memory usage getting lower again. More to come!\nAWS EBS volume encryption by default (gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws#147) The Shoot API already exposed the possibility to encrypt the root disks of worker nodes since quite a while, but it was disabled by default (for backwards-compatibility reasons). With this release we have change this default, so new shoot worker nodes will be provisioned with encrypted root disks out-of-the-box. However, the g4dn instance types of AWS don\u0026rsquo;t support this encryption, so when you use them you have to explicitly disable the encryption in the worker pool configuration.\nLiveness probe for Gardener API server deployment (gardener/gardener#2647) A small, but very valuable improvement is the introduction of a liveness probe for our Gardener API server. As it\u0026rsquo;s built with the same library like the Kubernetes API server, it exposes two endpoints at /livez and /readyz which were created exactly for the purpose of live- and readiness probes. With Gardener v1.8 the Helm chart contains a liveness probe configuration by default, and we are awaiting an upstream fix (kubernetes/kubernetes#93599) to also enable the readiness probe. This will help in a smoother rolling update of the Gardener API server pods, i.e., preventing clients from talking to a not yet initialized or already terminating API server instance.\nWebhook ports changed to enable OpenShift (gardener/gardener#2660) In order to make it possible to run Gardener on OpenShift clusters as well, we had to make a change in the port configuration for the webhooks we are using in both Gardener and the extension controllers. Earlier, all the webhook servers directly exposed port 443, i.e., a system port which is a security concern and disallowed in OpenShift. We have changed this port now across all places and also adapted our network policies accordingly. This is most likely not the last necessary change to enable this scenario, however, it\u0026rsquo;s a great improvement to push the project forward.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in more details and even more improvements you can find all release notes for Gardener v1.8.0 here: https://github.com/gardener/gardener/releases/tag/v1.8.0\n"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/blog/2020-05/00/","title":"PingCAP’s Experience in Implementing their Managed TiDB Service with Gardener","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Gardener is showing successful collaboration with its growing community of contributors and adopters. With this come some success stories, including PingCAP using Gardener to implement its managed service.\nAbout PingCAP and its TiDB Cloud PingCAP started in 2015, when three seasoned infrastructure engineers working at leading Internet companies got sick and tired of the way databases were managed, scaled and maintained. Seeing no good solution on the market, they decided to build their own - the open-source way. With the help of a first-class team and hundreds of contributors from around the globe, PingCAP is building a distributed NewSQL, hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) database.\nIts flagship project, TiDB, is a cloud-native distributed SQL database with MySQL compatibility, and one of the most popular open-source database projects - with 23.5K+ stars and 400+ contributors. Its sister project TiKV is a Cloud Native Interactive Landscape project.\nPingCAP envisioned their managed TiDB service, known as TiDB Cloud, to be multi-tenant, secure, cost-efficient, and to be compatible with different cloud providers. As a result, the company turned to Gardener to build their managed TiDB cloud service offering.\nTiDB Cloud Beta Preview Limitations with other public managed Kubernetes services Previously, PingCAP encountered issues while using other public managed K8s cluster services, to develop the first version of its TiDB Cloud. Their worst pain point was that they felt helpless when encountering certain malfunctions. PingCAP wasn’t able to do much to resolve these issues, except waiting for the providers’ help. More specifically, they experienced problems due to cloud-provider specific Kubernetes system upgrades, delays in the support response (which could be avoided in exchange of a costly support fee), and no control over when things got fixed.\nThere was also a lot of cloud-specific integration work needed to follow a multi-cloud strategy, which proved to be expensive both to produce and maintain. With one of these managed K8s services, you would have to integrate the instance API, as opposed to a solution like Gardener, which provides a unified API for all clouds. Such a unified API eliminates the need to worry about cloud specific-integration work altogether.\nWhy PingCAP chose Gardener to build TiDB Cloud  “Gardener has similar concepts to Kubernetes. Each Kubernetes cluster is just like a Kubernetes pod, so the similar concepts apply, and the controller pattern makes Gardener easy to manage. It was also easy to extend, as the team was already very familiar with Kubernetes, so it wasn’t hard for us to extend Gardener. We also saw that Gardener has a very active community, which is always a plus!”- Aylei Wu, (Cloud Engineer) at PingCAP\n At first glance, PingCAP had initial reservations about using Gardener - mainly due to its adoption level (still at the beginning) and an apparent complexity of use. However, these were soon eliminated as they learned more about the solution. As Aylei Wu mentioned during the last Gardener community meeting, “a good product speaks for itself”, and once the company got familiar with Gardener, they quickly noticed that the concepts were very similar to Kubernetes, which they were already familiar with.\nThey recognized that Gardener would be their best option, as it is highly extensible and provides a unified abstraction API layer. In essence, the machines can be managed via a machine controller manager for different cloud providers - without having to worry about the individual cloud APIs.\nThey agreed that Gardener’s solution, although complex, was definitely worth it. Even though it is a relatively new solution, meaning they didn’t have access to other user testimonials, they decided to go with the service since it checked all the boxes (and as SAP was running it productively with a huge fleet). PingCAP also came to the conclusion that building a managed Kubernetes service themselves would not be easy. Even if they were to build a managed K8s service, they would have to heavily invest in development and would still end up with an even more complex platform than Gardener’s. For all these reasons combined, PingCAP decided to go with Gardener to build its TiDB Cloud.\nHere are certain features of Gardener that PingCAP found appealing:\n Cloud agnostic: Gardener’s abstractions for cloud-specific integrations dramatically reduce the investment in supporting more than one cloud infrastructure. Once the integration with Amazon Web Services was done, moving on to Google Cloud Platform proved to be relatively easy. (At the moment, TiDB Cloud has subscription plans available for both GCP and AWS, and they are planning to support Alibaba Cloud in the future.) Familiar concepts: Gardener is K8s native; its concepts are easily related to core Kubernetes concepts. As such, it was easy to onboard for a K8s experienced team like PingCAP’s SRE team. Easy to manage and extend: Gardener’s API and extensibility are easy to implement, which has a positive impact on the implementation, maintenance costs and time-to-market. Active community: Prompt and quality responses on Slack from the Gardener team tremendously helped to quickly onboard and produce an efficient solution.  How PingCAP built TiDB Cloud with Gardener On a technical level, PingCAP’s set-up overview includes the following:\n A Base Cluster globally, which is the top-level control plane of TiDB Cloud A Seed Cluster per cloud provider per region, which makes up the fundamental data plane of TiDB Cloud A Shoot Cluster is dynamically provisioned per tenant per cloud provider per region when requested A tenant may create one or more TiDB clusters in a Shoot Cluster  As a real world example, PingCAP sets up the Base Cluster and Seed Clusters in advance. When a tenant creates its first TiDB cluster under the us-west-2 region of AWS, a Shoot Cluster will be dynamically provisioned in this region, and will host all the TiDB clusters of this tenant under us-west-2. Nevertheless, if another tenant requests a TiDB cluster in the same region, a new Shoot Cluster will be provisioned. Since different Shoot Clusters are located in different VPCs and can even be hosted under different AWS accounts, TiDB Cloud is able to achieve hard isolation between tenants and meet the critical security requirements for our customers.\nTo automate these processes, PingCAP creates a service in the Base Cluster, known as the TiDB Cloud “Central” service. The Central is responsible for managing shoots and the TiDB clusters in the Shoot Clusters. As shown in the following diagram, user operations go to the Central, being authenticated, authorized, validated, stored and then applied asynchronously in a controller manner. The Central will talk to the Gardener API Server to create and scale Shoot clusters. The Central will also access the Shoot API Service to deploy and reconcile components in the Shoot cluster, including control components (TiDB Operator, API Proxy, Usage Reporter for billing, etc.) and the TiDB clusters.\nTiDB Cloud on Gardener Architecture Overview What’s next for PingCAP and Gardener With the initial success of using the project to build TiDB Cloud, PingCAP is now working heavily on the stability and day-to-day operations of TiDB Cloud on Gardener. This includes writing Infrastructure-as-Code scripts/controllers with it to achieve GitOps, building tools to help diagnose problems across regions and clusters, as well as running chaos tests to identify and eliminate potential risks. After benefiting greatly from the community, PingCAP will continue to contribute back to Gardener.\nIn the future, PingCAP also plans to support more cloud providers like AliCloud and Azure. Moreover, PingCAP may explore the opportunity of running TiDB Cloud in on-premise data centers with the constantly expanding support this project provides. Engineers at PingCAP enjoy the ease of learning from Gardener’s kubernetes-like concepts and being able to apply them everywhere. Gone are the days of heavy integrations with different clouds and worrying about vendor stability. With this project, PingCAP now sees broader opportunities to land TiDB Cloud on various infrastructures to meet the needs of their global user group.\nStay tuned, more blog posts to come on how Gardener is collaborating with its contributors and adopters to bring fully-managed clusters at scale everywhere!

You need to make sure command curl is installed in the container. You can also find out the dns name of the ClusterIP by command kubectl exec -it \u0026lt;POD_NAME\u0026gt; nslookup \u0026lt;ClusterIP\u0026gt;, replace the IP address with the resolved name in your test. The resolved name typically looks like nginx-svc.default.svc.cluster.local where nginx-svc is the name of your service defined in the configuration file.   Type NodePort Follow the previous example, just replace the type with NodePort\n...spec:type:NodePortports:- port:80...A service of type NodePort is a ClusterIP service with an additional capability: it is reachable at the IP address of the node as well as at the assigned cluster IP on the services network. The way this is accomplished is pretty straightforward: when Kubernetes creates a NodePort service kube-proxy allocates a port in the range 30000–32767 and opens this port on every node (thus the name “NodePort”). Connections to this port are forwarded to the service’s cluster IP. If we create the service above and run kubectl get svc \u0026lt;your-service\u0026gt;, we can see the NodePort that has been allocated for it.\nNote that in the in following example, in addition to port 80, port 32521 has been opened as well on the node, in contrast to the output of \u0026ldquo;ClusterIP\u0026rdquo; case where only port 80 is opened.\n$ kubectl get svc nginx-svc NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE nginx-svc NodePort 100.70.105.182 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 80:32521/TCP 16m Therefore you can access the service from within the cluster in two ways:\n Access via ClusterIP:port  #via ClusterIP kubectl exec -it nginx-deployment-74d949bf69-7n6bs curl 100.70.105.182:80 #via internal name of ClusterIP kubectl exec -it nginx-deployment-74d949bf69-7n6bs curl nginx-svc.default.svc.cluster.local:80  Access via NodeIP:NodePort  # First find out the Node IP address $ kubectl describe node Name: ip-10-250-20-203.eu-central-1.compute.internal Roles: node Addresses: InternalIP: 10.250.20.203 InternalDNS: ip-10-250-20-203.eu-central-1.compute.internal Hostname: ip-10-250-20-203.eu-central-1.compute.internal ... #via NodeIP:NodePort kubectl exec -it nginx-deployment-74d949bf69-7n6bs curl 10.250.20.203:32521 #via internal name of NodeIP kubectl exec -it nginx-deployment-74d949bf69-7n6bs curl ip-10-250-20-203.eu-central-1.compute.internal:32521 Type LoadBalancer The LoadBalancer type is the simplest approach, which is created by specifying type as LoadBalancer.\napiVersion:apps/v1kind:Deploymentmetadata:name:nginx-deploymentspec:selector:matchLabels:app:nginx-appreplicas:1template:metadata:labels:app:nginx-appspec:containers:- name:nginximage:nginx:1.13.12ports:- containerPort:80---apiVersion:v1kind:Servicemetadata:labels:app:nginx-appname:nginx-svcnamespace:defaultspec:type:LoadBalancer# use LoadBalancer as type hereports:- port:80selector:app:nginx-appOnce the service is created, it has an external IP address as shown here:\n$ kubectl get services -l app=nginx-app -o wide NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE SELECTOR nginx-svc LoadBalancer 100.67.182.148 a54a62300696611e88ba00af02406931-1787163476.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com 80:31196/TCP 9m app=nginx-app A service of type LoadBalancer combines the capabilities of a NodePort with the ability to setup a complete ingress path.\nHence the service can be accessible from outside the cluster without the need for additional components like an Ingress.\nTo test the external IP run this curl command from your local machine:\n$ curl http://a54a62300696611e88ba00af02406931-1787163476.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com StatusCode : 200 StatusDescription : OK Content : \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Welcome to nginx!\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; body { width: 35em; margin: 0 auto; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;... RawContent : HTTP/1.1 200 OK ... Obviously the service can also is accessed from within the cluster. You can test this in the same way as described in section NodePort.\nLoadBalancer vs. Ingress As presented in the previous section, only the service type LoadBalancer enables access from outside the cluster. However this approach has its own limitation. You cannot configure a LoadBalancer to terminate HTTPS traffic, virtual hosts or path-based routing. In Kubernetes 1.2 a separate resource called Ingress is introduced for this purpose.\nWhy an Ingress LoadBalancer services are all about extending a service to support external clients. By contrast an Ingress is a a separate resource that configures a LoadBalancer in a more flexible way. The Ingress API supports TLS termination, virtual hosts, and path-based routing. It can easily set up a load balancer to handle multiple backend services. In addition routing traffic is realised in a different way. In the case of the LoadBalancer service, the traffic entering through the external load balancer is forwarded to the kube-proxy that in turn forwards the traffic to the selected pods. In contrast, the Ingress LoadBalancer forwards the traffic straight to the selected pods which is more efficient.\nTypically a service of type LoadBalancer costs at least 40$ per month. This means if your applications needs 10 of them you already pay 400$ per month just for load balancing.\nHow to use the ingress? In the cluster, a nginx-ingress controller has been deployed for you as an LoadBalancer and also registered the DNS record. Depending on how your cluster is defined, the DNS registration is performed under following conventions:\n k8s-hana.ondemand.com  \u0026lt;gardener_cluster_name\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;gardener_project_name\u0026gt;.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com.\nBoth \u0026lt;gardener_cluster_name\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;gardener_project_name\u0026gt; are defined in Gardener which can be determined on Gardener dashboard.\nThis results in the following default DNS endpoints:\n api.\u0026lt;cluster_domain\u0026gt; Kubernetes API *.ingress.\u0026lt;cluster_domain\u0026gt; Internal nginx ingress  Example: Configure an Ingress resource with Service type: NodePort With the configuration below you can reach your service nginx-svc with:\nhttp://test.ingress.\u0026amp;lt;GARDENER-CLUSTER-NAME\u0026amp;gt;.\u0026amp;lt;GARDENER-PROJECT-NAME\u0026amp;gt;.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com\napiVersion:apps/v1kind:Deploymentmetadata:name:nginx-deploymentspec:selector:matchLabels:app:nginx-appreplicas:1template:metadata:labels:app:nginx-appspec:containers:- name:nginximage:nginx:1.13.12ports:- containerPort:80---apiVersion:v1kind:Servicemetadata:labels:app:nginx-appname:nginx-svcnamespace:defaultspec:type:NodePortports:- port:80selector:app:nginx-app---apiVersion:networking.k8s.io/v1beta1kind:Ingressmetadata:name:nginxsvc-ingressspec:rules:- host:nginxsvc.ingress.eecluster.cpet.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.comhttp:paths:- backend:serviceName:nginx-svcservicePort:80Show the newly created ingress and test it :\n$ kubectl get ingress NAME HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE nginxsvc-ingress nginxsvc.ingress.eecluster.cpet.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com 10.250.20.203 80 29s $ curl nginxsvc.ingress.eecluster.cpet.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com StatusCode : 200 StatusDescription : OK Content : \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Welcome to nginx!\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; body { width: 35em; margin: 0 auto; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; ...

If we create the service above and run kubectl get svc \u0026lt;your-service\u0026gt;, we can see the NodePort that has been allocated for it.\nNote that in the in following example, in addition to port 80, port 32521 has been opened as well on the node, in contrast to the output of \u0026ldquo;ClusterIP\u0026rdquo; case where only port 80 is opened.\n$ kubectl get svc nginx-svc NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE nginx-svc NodePort 100.70.105.182 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 80:32521/TCP 16m Therefore you can access the service from within the cluster in two ways:\n Access via ClusterIP:port  #via ClusterIP kubectl exec -it nginx-deployment-74d949bf69-7n6bs curl 100.70.105.182:80 #via internal name of ClusterIP kubectl exec -it nginx-deployment-74d949bf69-7n6bs curl nginx-svc.default.svc.cluster.local:80  Access via NodeIP:NodePort  # First find out the Node IP address $ kubectl describe node Name: ip-10-250-20-203.eu-central-1.compute.internal Roles: node Addresses: InternalIP: 10.250.20.203 InternalDNS: ip-10-250-20-203.eu-central-1.compute.internal Hostname: ip-10-250-20-203.eu-central-1.compute.internal ... #via NodeIP:NodePort kubectl exec -it nginx-deployment-74d949bf69-7n6bs curl 10.250.20.203:32521 #via internal name of NodeIP kubectl exec -it nginx-deployment-74d949bf69-7n6bs curl ip-10-250-20-203.eu-central-1.compute.internal:32521 Type LoadBalancer The LoadBalancer type is the simplest approach, which is created by specifying type as LoadBalancer.\napiVersion:apps/v1kind:Deploymentmetadata:name:nginx-deploymentspec:selector:matchLabels:app:nginx-appreplicas:1template:metadata:labels:app:nginx-appspec:containers:- name:nginximage:nginx:1.13.12ports:- containerPort:80---apiVersion:v1kind:Servicemetadata:labels:app:nginx-appname:nginx-svcnamespace:defaultspec:type:LoadBalancer# use LoadBalancer as type hereports:- port:80selector:app:nginx-appOnce the service is created, it has an external IP address as shown here:\n$ kubectl get services -l app=nginx-app -o wide NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE SELECTOR nginx-svc LoadBalancer 100.67.182.148 a54a62300696611e88ba00af02406931-1787163476.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com 80:31196/TCP 9m app=nginx-app A service of type LoadBalancer combines the capabilities of a NodePort with the ability to setup a complete ingress path.\nHence the service can be accessible from outside the cluster without the need for additional components like an Ingress.\nTo test the external IP run this curl command from your local machine:\n$ curl http://a54a62300696611e88ba00af02406931-1787163476.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com StatusCode : 200 StatusDescription : OK Content : \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Welcome to nginx!\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; body { width: 35em; margin: 0 auto; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;... RawContent : HTTP/1.1 200 OK ... Obviously the service can also is accessed from within the cluster. You can test this in the same way as described in section NodePort.\nLoadBalancer vs. Ingress As presented in the previous section, only the service type LoadBalancer enables access from outside the cluster. However this approach has its own limitation. You cannot configure a LoadBalancer to terminate HTTPS traffic, virtual hosts or path-based routing. In Kubernetes 1.2 a separate resource called Ingress is introduced for this purpose.\nWhy an Ingress LoadBalancer services are all about extending a service to support external clients. By contrast an Ingress is a a separate resource that configures a LoadBalancer in a more flexible way. The Ingress API supports TLS termination, virtual hosts, and path-based routing. It can easily set up a load balancer to handle multiple backend services. In addition routing traffic is realised in a different way. In the case of the LoadBalancer service, the traffic entering through the external load balancer is forwarded to the kube-proxy that in turn forwards the traffic to the selected pods. In contrast, the Ingress LoadBalancer forwards the traffic straight to the selected pods which is more efficient.\nTypically a service of type LoadBalancer costs at least 40$ per month. This means if your applications needs 10 of them you already pay 400$ per month just for load balancing.\nHow to use the ingress? In the cluster, a nginx-ingress controller has been deployed for you as an LoadBalancer and also registered the DNS record. Depending on how your cluster is defined, the DNS registration is performed under following conventions:\n k8s-hana.ondemand.com  \u0026lt;gardener_cluster_name\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;gardener_project_name\u0026gt;.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com.\nBoth \u0026lt;gardener_cluster_name\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;gardener_project_name\u0026gt; are defined in Gardener which can be determined on Gardener dashboard.\nThis results in the following default DNS endpoints:\n api.\u0026lt;cluster_domain\u0026gt; Kubernetes API *.ingress.\u0026lt;cluster_domain\u0026gt; Internal nginx ingress  Example: Configure an Ingress resource with Service type: NodePort With the configuration below you can reach your service nginx-svc with:\nhttp://test.ingress.\u0026amp;lt;GARDENER-CLUSTER-NAME\u0026amp;gt;.\u0026amp;lt;GARDENER-PROJECT-NAME\u0026amp;gt;.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com\napiVersion:apps/v1kind:Deploymentmetadata:name:nginx-deploymentspec:selector:matchLabels:app:nginx-appreplicas:1template:metadata:labels:app:nginx-appspec:containers:- name:nginximage:nginx:1.13.12ports:- containerPort:80---apiVersion:v1kind:Servicemetadata:labels:app:nginx-appname:nginx-svcnamespace:defaultspec:type:NodePortports:- port:80selector:app:nginx-app---apiVersion:networking.k8s.io/v1beta1kind:Ingressmetadata:name:nginxsvc-ingressspec:rules:- host:nginxsvc.ingress.eecluster.cpet.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.comhttp:paths:- backend:serviceName:nginx-svcservicePort:80Show the newly created ingress and test it :\n$ kubectl get ingress NAME HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE nginxsvc-ingress nginxsvc.ingress.eecluster.cpet.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com 10.250.20.203 80 29s $ curl nginxsvc.ingress.eecluster.cpet.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com StatusCode : 200 StatusDescription : OK Content : \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Welcome to nginx!\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; body { width: 35em; margin: 0 auto; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; ...

You need to make sure command curl is installed in the container. You can also find out the dns name of the ClusterIP by command kubectl exec -it \u0026lt;POD_NAME\u0026gt; nslookup \u0026lt;ClusterIP\u0026gt;, replace the IP address with the resolved name in your test.

The goal of this ongoing work is to increase the security of all Gardener stakeholders in the open source community. Following the Gardener architecture, the control plane of a Gardener managed shoot cluster resides in the corresponding seed cluster. This is a Control-Plane-as-a-Service with a network air gap.\nAlong the way we found various kinds of security issues, for example, due to misconfiguration or missing isolation, as well as two special problems with upstream Kubernetes and its Control-Plane-as-a-Service architecture.\nMajor Findings From this experience, we’d like to share a few examples of security issues that could happen on a Kubernetes installation and how to fix them.\nAlban Crequy (Kinvolk) and Dirk Marwinski (SAP SE) gave a presentation entitled Hardening Multi-Cloud Kubernetes Clusters as a Service at KubeCon 2018 in Shanghai presenting some of the findings.\nHere is a summary of the findings:\n  Privilege escalation due to insecure configuration of the Kubernetes API server\n Root cause: Same certificate authority (CA) is used for both the API server and the proxy that allows accessing the API server. Risk: Users can get access to the API server. Recommendation: Always use different CAs.    Exploration of the control plane network with malicious HTTP-redirects\n  Root cause: See detailed description below.\n  Risk: Provoked error message contains full HTTP payload from an existing endpoint which can be exploited. The contents of the payload depends on your setup, but can potentially be user data, configuration data, and credentials.\n  Recommendation:\n Use the latest version of Gardener Ensure the seed cluster\u0026rsquo;s container network supports network policies. Clusters that have been created with Kubify are not protected as Flannel is used there which doesn\u0026rsquo;t support network policies.      Reading private AWS metadata via Grafana\n Root cause: It is possible to configuring a new custom data source in Grafana, we could send HTTP requests to target the control Risk: Users can get the \u0026ldquo;user-data\u0026rdquo; for the seed cluster from the metadata service and retrieve a kubeconfig for that Kubernetes cluster Recommendation: Lockdown Grafana features to only what\u0026rsquo;s necessary in this setup, block all unnecessary outgoing traffic, move Grafana to a different network, lockdown unauthenticated endpoints    Scenario 1: Privilege Escalation with Insecure API Server In most configurations, different components connect directly to the Kubernetes API server, often using a kubeconfig with a client certificate. The API server is started with the flag:\n/hyperkube apiserver --client-ca-file=/srv/kubernetes/ca/ca.crt ... The API server will check whether the client certificate presented by kubectl, kubelet, scheduler or another component is really signed by the configured certificate authority for clients.\n The API server can have many clients of various kinds  However, it is possible to configure the API server differently for use with an intermediate authenticating proxy. The proxy will authenticate the client with its own custom method and then issue HTTP requests to the API server with additional HTTP headers specifying the user name and group name. The API server should only accept HTTP requests with HTTP headers from a legitimate proxy. To allow the API server to check incoming requests, you need pass on a list of certificate authorities (CAs) to it. Requests coming from a proxy are only accepted if they use a client certificate that is signed by one of the CAs of that list.\n--requestheader-client-ca-file=/srv/kubernetes/ca/ca-proxy.crt --requestheader-username-headers=X-Remote-User --requestheader-group-headers=X-Remote-Group  API server clients can reach the API server through an authenticating proxy  So far, so good. But what happens if malicious user “Mallory” tries to connect directly to the API server and reuses the HTTP headers to pretend to be someone else?\n What happens when a client bypasses the proxy, connecting directly to the API server?  With a correct configuration, Mallory’s kubeconfig will have a certificate signed by the API server certificate authority but not signed by the proxy certificate authority. So the API server will not accept the extra HTTP header “X-Remote-Group: system:masters”.\nYou only run into an issue when the same certificate authority is used for both the API server and the proxy. Then, any Kubernetes client certificate can be used to take the role of different user or group as the API server will accept the user header and group header.\nThe kubectl tool does not normally add those HTTP headers but it’s pretty easy to generate the corresponding HTTP requests manually.\nWe worked on improving the Kubernetes documentation to make clearer that this configuration should be avoided.\nScenario 2: Exploration of the Control Plane Network with Malicious HTTP-Redirects The API server is a central component of Kubernetes and many components initiate connections to it, including the Kubelet running on worker nodes. Most of the requests from those clients will end up updating Kubernetes objects (pods, services, deployments, and so on) in the etcd database but the API server usually does not need to initiate TCP connections itself.\n The API server is mostly a component that receives requests  However, there are exceptions. Some kubectl commands will trigger the API server to open a new connection to the Kubelet. Kubectl exec is one of those commands. In order to get the standard I/Os from the pod, the API server will start an HTTP connection to the Kubelet on the worker node where the pod is running. Depending on the container runtime used, it can be done in different ways, but one way to do it is for the Kubelet to reply with a HTTP-302 redirection to the Container Runtime Interface (CRI). Basically, the Kubelet is telling the API server to get the streams from CRI itself directly instead of forwarding. The redirection from the Kubelet will only change the port and path from the URL; the IP address will not be changed because the Kubelet and the CRI component run on the same worker node.\n But the API server also initiates some connections, for example, to worker nodes  It’s often quite easy for users of a Kubernetes cluster to get access to worker nodes and tamper with the Kubelet. They could be given explicit SSH access or they could be given a kubeconfig with enough privileges to create privileged pods or even just pods with “host” volumes.\nIn contrast, users — even those with “system:masters” permissions or “root” rights — are often not given access to the control plane. On setups like for example GKE or Gardener, the control plane is running on separate nodes, with a different administrative access. It could be hosted on a different cloud provider account. So users are not free to explore the internal network in the control plane.\nWhat would happen if a user was tampering with the Kubelet to make it maliciously redirect kubectl exec requests to a different random endpoint? Most likely the given endpoint would not speak the streaming server protocol, so there would be an error. However, the full HTTP payload from the endpoint is included in the error message printed by kubectl exec.\n The API server is tricked to connect to other components  The impact of this issue depends on the specific setup. But in many configurations, we could find a metadata service (such as the AWS metadata service) containing user data, configurations and credentials. The setup we explored had a different AWS account and a different EC2 instance profile for the worker nodes and the control plane. This issue allowed users to get access to the AWS metadata service in the context of the control plane, which they should not have access to.\nWe have reported this issue to the Kubernetes Security mailing list and the public pull request that addresses the issue has been merged PR#66516. It provides a way to enforce HTTP redirect validation (disabled by default).\nBut there are several other ways that users could trigger the API server to generate HTTP requests and get the reply payload back, so it is advised to isolate the API server and other components from the network as additional precautious measures. Depending on where the API server runs, it could be with Kubernetes Network Policies, EC2 Security Groups or just iptables directly. Following the defense in depth principle, it is a good idea to apply the API server HTTP redirect validation when it is available as well as firewall rules.\nIn Gardener, this has been fixed with Kubernetes network policies along with changes to ensure the API server does not need to contact the metadata service. You can see more details in the announcements on the Gardener mailing list. This is tracked in CVE-2018-2475.\nTo be protected from this issue, stakeholders should:\n Use the latest version of Gardener Ensure the seed cluster’s container network supports network policies. Clusters that have been created with Kubify are not protected as Flannel is used there which doesn’t support network policies.  Scenario 3: Reading Private AWS Metadata via Grafana For our tests, we had access to a Kubernetes setup where users are not only given access to the API server in the control plane, but also to a Grafana instance that is used to gather data from their Kubernetes clusters via Prometheus. The control plane is managed and users don’t have access to the nodes that it runs. They can only access the API server and Grafana via a load balancer. The internal network of the control plane is therefore hidden to users.\n Prometheus and Grafana can be used to monitor worker nodes  Unfortunately, that setup was not protecting the control plane network from nosy users. By configuring a new custom data source in Grafana, we could send HTTP requests to target the control plane network, for example the AWS metadata service. The reply payload is not displayed on the Grafana Web UI but it is possible to access it from the debugging console of the Chrome browser.\n Credentials can be retrieved from the debugging console of Chrome   Adding a Grafana data source is a way to issue HTTP requests to arbitrary targets  In that installation, users could get the “user-data” for the seed cluster from the metadata service and retrieve a kubeconfig for that Kubernetes cluster.\nThere are many possible measures to avoid this situation: lockdown Grafana features to only what’s necessary in this setup, block all unnecessary outgoing traffic, move Grafana to a different network, lockdown unauthenticated endpoints.\nConclusion The three scenarios above show pitfalls with a Kubernetes setup. A lot of them were specific to the Kubernetes installation: different cloud providers or different configurations will show different weakness. Users should no longer be given access to Grafana.\n"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/v1.12.8/guides/applications/insecure-configuration/","title":"Auditing Kubernetes for Secure Setup","tags":[],"description":"A few insecure configurations in Kubernetes","content":"Auditing Kubernetes for Secure Setup \u0026lt;object type=\u0026quot;image/svg+xml\u0026quot; data=\u0026quot;./images/teaser.svg\u0026quot; style=\u0026quot;;visibility:hidden; margin: 3rem auto;display: block;\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;inline reveal-fast drop-shadow\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/object\u0026gt;  Increasing the Security of all Gardener Stakeholders In summer 2018, the Gardener project team asked Kinvolk to execute several penetration tests in its role as third-party contractor.

Exploration of the control plane network with malicious HTTP-redirects\n  Root cause: See detailed description below.\n  Risk: Provoked error message contains full HTTP payload from an existing endpoint which can be exploited. The contents of the payload depends on your setup, but can potentially be user data, configuration data, and credentials.\n  Recommendation:\n Use the latest version of Gardener Ensure the seed cluster\u0026rsquo;s container network supports network policies. Clusters that have been created with Kubify are not protected as Flannel is used there which doesn\u0026rsquo;t support network policies.      Reading private AWS metadata via Grafana\n Root cause: It is possible to configuring a new custom data source in Grafana, we could send HTTP requests to target the control Risk: Users can get the \u0026ldquo;user-data\u0026rdquo; for the seed cluster from the metadata service and retrieve a kubeconfig for that Kubernetes cluster Recommendation: Lockdown Grafana features to only what\u0026rsquo;s necessary in this setup, block all unnecessary outgoing traffic, move Grafana to a different network, lockdown unauthenticated endpoints    Scenario 1: Privilege Escalation with Insecure API Server In most configurations, different components connect directly to the Kubernetes API server, often using a kubeconfig with a client certificate. The API server is started with the flag:\n/hyperkube apiserver --client-ca-file=/srv/kubernetes/ca/ca.crt ... The API server will check whether the client certificate presented by kubectl, kubelet, scheduler or another component is really signed by the configured certificate authority for clients.\n The API server can have many clients of various kinds  However, it is possible to configure the API server differently for use with an intermediate authenticating proxy. The proxy will authenticate the client with its own custom method and then issue HTTP requests to the API server with additional HTTP headers specifying the user name and group name. The API server should only accept HTTP requests with HTTP headers from a legitimate proxy. To allow the API server to check incoming requests, you need pass on a list of certificate authorities (CAs) to it. Requests coming from a proxy are only accepted if they use a client certificate that is signed by one of the CAs of that list.\n--requestheader-client-ca-file=/srv/kubernetes/ca/ca-proxy.crt --requestheader-username-headers=X-Remote-User --requestheader-group-headers=X-Remote-Group  API server clients can reach the API server through an authenticating proxy  So far, so good. But what happens if malicious user “Mallory” tries to connect directly to the API server and reuses the HTTP headers to pretend to be someone else?\n What happens when a client bypasses the proxy, connecting directly to the API server?  With a correct configuration, Mallory’s kubeconfig will have a certificate signed by the API server certificate authority but not signed by the proxy certificate authority. So the API server will not accept the extra HTTP header “X-Remote-Group: system:masters”.\nYou only run into an issue when the same certificate authority is used for both the API server and the proxy. Then, any Kubernetes client certificate can be used to take the role of different user or group as the API server will accept the user header and group header.\nThe kubectl tool does not normally add those HTTP headers but it’s pretty easy to generate the corresponding HTTP requests manually.\nWe worked on improving the Kubernetes documentation to make clearer that this configuration should be avoided.\nScenario 2: Exploration of the Control Plane Network with Malicious HTTP-Redirects The API server is a central component of Kubernetes and many components initiate connections to it, including the Kubelet running on worker nodes. Most of the requests from those clients will end up updating Kubernetes objects (pods, services, deployments, and so on) in the etcd database but the API server usually does not need to initiate TCP connections itself.\n The API server is mostly a component that receives requests  However, there are exceptions. Some kubectl commands will trigger the API server to open a new connection to the Kubelet. Kubectl exec is one of those commands. In order to get the standard I/Os from the pod, the API server will start an HTTP connection to the Kubelet on the worker node where the pod is running. Depending on the container runtime used, it can be done in different ways, but one way to do it is for the Kubelet to reply with a HTTP-302 redirection to the Container Runtime Interface (CRI). Basically, the Kubelet is telling the API server to get the streams from CRI itself directly instead of forwarding. The redirection from the Kubelet will only change the port and path from the URL; the IP address will not be changed because the Kubelet and the CRI component run on the same worker node.\n But the API server also initiates some connections, for example, to worker nodes  It’s often quite easy for users of a Kubernetes cluster to get access to worker nodes and tamper with the Kubelet. They could be given explicit SSH access or they could be given a kubeconfig with enough privileges to create privileged pods or even just pods with “host” volumes.\nIn contrast, users — even those with “system:masters” permissions or “root” rights — are often not given access to the control plane. On setups like for example GKE or Gardener, the control plane is running on separate nodes, with a different administrative access. It could be hosted on a different cloud provider account. So users are not free to explore the internal network in the control plane.\nWhat would happen if a user was tampering with the Kubelet to make it maliciously redirect kubectl exec requests to a different random endpoint? Most likely the given endpoint would not speak the streaming server protocol, so there would be an error. However, the full HTTP payload from the endpoint is included in the error message printed by kubectl exec.\n The API server is tricked to connect to other components  The impact of this issue depends on the specific setup. But in many configurations, we could find a metadata service (such as the AWS metadata service) containing user data, configurations and credentials. The setup we explored had a different AWS account and a different EC2 instance profile for the worker nodes and the control plane. This issue allowed users to get access to the AWS metadata service in the context of the control plane, which they should not have access to.\nWe have reported this issue to the Kubernetes Security mailing list and the public pull request that addresses the issue has been merged PR#66516. It provides a way to enforce HTTP redirect validation (disabled by default).\nBut there are several other ways that users could trigger the API server to generate HTTP requests and get the reply payload back, so it is advised to isolate the API server and other components from the network as additional precautious measures. Depending on where the API server runs, it could be with Kubernetes Network Policies, EC2 Security Groups or just iptables directly. Following the defense in depth principle, it is a good idea to apply the API server HTTP redirect validation when it is available as well as firewall rules.\nIn Gardener, this has been fixed with Kubernetes network policies along with changes to ensure the API server does not need to contact the metadata service. You can see more details in the announcements on the Gardener mailing list. This is tracked in CVE-2018-2475.\nTo be protected from this issue, stakeholders should:\n Use the latest version of Gardener Ensure the seed cluster’s container network supports network policies. Clusters that have been created with Kubify are not protected as Flannel is used there which doesn’t support network policies.  Scenario 3: Reading Private AWS Metadata via Grafana For our tests, we had access to a Kubernetes setup where users are not only given access to the API server in the control plane, but also to a Grafana instance that is used to gather data from their Kubernetes clusters via Prometheus. The control plane is managed and users don’t have access to the nodes that it runs. They can only access the API server and Grafana via a load balancer. The internal network of the control plane is therefore hidden to users.\n Prometheus and Grafana can be used to monitor worker nodes  Unfortunately, that setup was not protecting the control plane network from nosy users. By configuring a new custom data source in Grafana, we could send HTTP requests to target the control plane network, for example the AWS metadata service. The reply payload is not displayed on the Grafana Web UI but it is possible to access it from the debugging console of the Chrome browser.\n Credentials can be retrieved from the debugging console of Chrome   Adding a Grafana data source is a way to issue HTTP requests to arbitrary targets  In that installation, users could get the “user-data” for the seed cluster from the metadata service and retrieve a kubeconfig for that Kubernetes cluster.\nThere are many possible measures to avoid this situation: lockdown Grafana features to only what’s necessary in this setup, block all unnecessary outgoing traffic, move Grafana to a different network, lockdown unauthenticated endpoints.\nConclusion The three scenarios above show pitfalls with a Kubernetes setup. A lot of them were specific to the Kubernetes installation: different cloud providers or different configurations will show different weakness. Users should no longer be given access to Grafana.\n"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/documentation/guides/client_tools/oidc-login/","title":"Authenticating with an Identity Provider","tags":[],"description":"Authenticating with an Identity Provider using OpenID Connect","content":"Authenticating In this blog you will learn how to:\n Configure an Identity Provider using OpenID Connect.

To make this data available in your garden cluster, create a configmap in your cluster via\nkubectl -n garden create configmap istio-files --from-file ./istio.yaml Now you need to create an AddonManifest that references this file and push it to Kubernetes.

It incorporates some of the requested features of the community but not yet all of them.\n Caution: This software is early alpha. It is not meant for production use and shall (currently) only serve as a possible outlook of what is possible with pre-deployed software on Gardener Kubernetes clusters.\n Installation If you want to deploy Bouquet on a target Gardener cluster, run the following:\nhelm install charts/bouquet \\  --name gardener-bouquet \\  --namespace garden This will deploy Bouquet with the required permissions into your garden cluster.\nStructure As of now, Bouquet comes with two new custom resources: AddonManifest and AddonInstance.\nAn AddonManifest can be considered equivalent to a Helm template. The manifest itself only contains metadata (like the name, default values etc.). The actual content of a manifest is specified via its source attribute. Currently, the only available source is a ConfigMap.\nAn AddonInstance references an AddonManifest and a target Shoot. It may also contain value overrides in its spec. As soon as an AddonInstance is created, Bouquet will apply the values to the templates and then ensure that the objects exist in the target shoot.

Configuration and Usage of Gardener as Operator/Administrator When we use the terms \u0026ldquo;operator/administrator\u0026rdquo; we refer to both the people deploying and operating Gardener. Gardener consists out of four components:\n gardener-apiserver, a Kubernetes-native API extension that serves custom resources in the Kubernetes-style (like Seeds and Shoots), and a component that contains multiple admission plugins. gardener-controller-manager, a component consisting out of multiple controllers that implement reconciliation and deletion flows for some of the custom resources (e.g., it contains the logic for maintaining Shoots, reconciling Plants, etc.). gardener-scheduler, a component that assigns newly created Shoot clusters to appropriate Seed clusters. gardenlet, a component running in seed clusters and consisting out of multiple controllers that implement reconciliation and deletion flows for some of the custom resources (e.g., it contains the logic for reconciliation and deletion of Shoots).  Each of these components have various configuration options. The gardener-apiserver uses the standard API server library maintained by the Kubernetes community, and as such it mainly supports command line flags. The two other components are using so-called componentconfig files that describe their configuration in a Kubernetes-style versioned object.\nConfiguration file for Gardener controller manager The Gardener controller manager does only support one command line flag which should be a path to a valid controller-manager configuration file. Please take a look at this example configuration.\nConfiguration file for Gardener scheduler The Gardener scheduler also only supports one command line flag which should be a path to a valid scheduler configuration file. Please take a look at this example configuration. Information about the concepts of the Gardener scheduler can be found here\nConfiguration file for Gardenlet The Gardenlet also only supports one command line flag which should be a path to a valid gardenlet configuration file. Please take a look at this example configuration. Information about the concepts of the Gardenlet can be found here\nSystem configuration After successful deployment of the four components you need to setup the system. Let\u0026rsquo;s first focus on some \u0026ldquo;static\u0026rdquo; configuration. When the gardenlet starts it scans the garden namespace of the garden cluster for Secrets that have influence on its reconciliation loops, mainly the Shoot reconciliation:\n  Internal domain secret, contains the DNS provider credentials (having appropriate privileges) which will be used to create/delete so-called \u0026ldquo;internal\u0026rdquo; DNS records for the Shoot clusters, please see this for an example.\n This secret is used in order to establish a stable endpoint for shoot clusters which is used internally by all control plane components. The DNS records are normal DNS records but called \u0026ldquo;internal\u0026rdquo; in our scenario because only the kubeconfigs for the control plane components use this endpoint when talking to the shoot clusters. It is forbidden to change the internal domain secret if there are existing shoot clusters.    Default domain secrets (optional), contain the DNS provider credentials (having appropriate privileges) which will be used to create/delete DNS records for a default domain for shoots (e.g., example.com), please see this for an example.\n Not every end-user/stakeholder/customer has its own domain, however, Gardener needs to create a DNS record for every shoot cluster. As landscape operator you might want to define a default domain owned and controlled by you that is used for all shoot clusters that don\u0026rsquo;t specify their own domain.    :warning: Please note that the mentioned domain secrets are only needed if you have at least one seed cluster that is not tainted with seed.gardener.cloud/disable-dns. Seeds with this taint don\u0026rsquo;t create any DNS records for shoots scheduled on it, hence, if you only have such seeds, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to create the domain secrets.\n  Alerting secrets (optional), contain the alerting configuration and credentials for the AlertManager to send email alerts. It is also possible to configure the monitoring stack to send alerts to an AlertManager not deployed by Gardener to handle alerting. Please see this for an example.\n If email alerting is configured:  An AlertManager is deployed into each seed cluster that handles the alerting for all shoots on the seed cluster. Gardener will inject the SMTP credentials into the configuration of the AlertManager. The AlertManager will send emails to the configured email address in case any alerts are firing.   If an external AlertManager is configured:  Each shoot has a Prometheus responsible for monitoring components and sending out alerts. The alerts will be sent to a URL configured in the alerting secret. This external AlertManager is not managed by Gardener and can be configured however the operator sees fit. Supported authentication types are no authentication, basic, or mutual TLS.      OpenVPN Diffie-Hellmann Key secret (optional), contains the self-generated Diffie-Hellmann key used by OpenVPN in your landscape, please see this for an example.\n If you don\u0026rsquo;t specify a custom key then a default key is used, but for productive landscapes it\u0026rsquo;s recommend to create a landscape-specific key and define it.    Global monitoring secrets (optional), contains basic authentication credentials for the Prometheus aggregating metrics for all clusters.\n These secrets are synced to each seed cluster and used to gain access to the aggregate monitoring components.    Apart from this \u0026ldquo;static\u0026rdquo; configuration there are several custom resources extending the Kubernetes API and used by Gardener. As an operator/administrator you have to configure some of them to make the system work.\nConfiguration and Usage of Gardener as End-User/Stakeholder/Customer As an end-user/stakeholder/customer you are using a Gardener landscape that has been setup for you by another team.

Every Shoot resource has a status.conditions[] list that contains the mentioned types, together with a status (True/False) and a descriptive message/explanation of the status.\nMost extension controllers are deploying components and resources as part of their reconciliation flows into the seed or shoot cluster. A prominent example for this is the ControlPlane controller that usually deploys a cloud-controller-manager or CSI controllers as part of the shoot control plane. Now that the extensions deploy resources into the cluster, especially resources that are essential for the functionality of the cluster, they might want to contribute to Gardener\u0026rsquo;s checks mentioned above.\nWhat can extensions do to contribute to Gardener\u0026rsquo;s health checks? Every extension resource in Gardener\u0026rsquo;s extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1 API group also has a status.conditions[] list (like the Shoot). Extension controllers can write conditions to the resource they are acting on and use a type that also exist in the shoot\u0026rsquo;s conditions. One exception is that APIServerAvailable can\u0026rsquo;t be used as the Gardener clearly can identify the status of this condition and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense for extensions to try to contribute/modify it.\nAs an example for the ControlPlane controller let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the following resource:\napiVersion:extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:ControlPlanemetadata:name:control-planenamespace:shoot--foo--barspec:...status:conditions:- type:ControlPlaneHealthystatus:\u0026#34;False\u0026#34;reason:DeploymentUnhealthymessage: \u0026#39;Deployment cloud-controller-manager is unhealthy:condition\u0026#34;Available\u0026#34;hasinvalid status False (expected True) due to MinimumReplicasUnavailable:Deploymentdoesnothaveminimumavailability.\u0026#39;lastUpdateTime:\u0026#34;2014-05-25T12:44:27Z\u0026#34;- type:ConfigComputedSuccessfullystatus:\u0026#34;True\u0026#34;reason:ConfigCreatedmessage:Thecloud-provider-confighasbeensuccessfullycomputed.lastUpdateTime:\u0026#34;2014-05-25T12:43:27Z\u0026#34;The extension controller has declared in its extension resource that one of the deployments it is responsible for is unhealthy. Also, it has written a second condition using a type that is unknown by Gardener.\nGardener will pick the list of conditions and recognize that the there is one with a type ControlPlaneHealthy. It will merge it with its own ControlPlaneHealthy condition and report it back to the Shoot's status:\napiVersion:core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1kind:Shootmetadata:labels:shoot.gardener.cloud/status:unhealthyname:some-shootnamespace:garden-corespec:status:conditions:- type:APIServerAvailablestatus:\u0026#34;True\u0026#34;reason:HealthzRequestSucceededmessage:APIserver/healthzendpointrespondedwithsuccessstatuscode.[response_time:31ms]lastUpdateTime:\u0026#34;2014-05-23T08:26:52Z\u0026#34;lastTransitionTime:\u0026#34;2014-05-25T12:45:13Z\u0026#34;- type:ControlPlaneHealthystatus:\u0026#34;False\u0026#34;reason:ControlPlaneUnhealthyReportmessage: \u0026#39;Deployment cloud-controller-manager is unhealthy:condition\u0026#34;Available\u0026#34;hasinvalid status False (expected True) due to MinimumReplicasUnavailable:Deploymentdoesnothaveminimumavailability.\u0026#39;lastUpdateTime:\u0026#34;2014-05-25T12:45:13Z\u0026#34;lastTransitionTime:\u0026#34;2014-05-25T12:45:13Z\u0026#34;...Hence, the only duty extensions have is to maintain the health status of their components in the extension resource they are managing. This can be accomplished using the health check library for extensions.\nError Codes The Gardener API includes some well-defined error codes, e.g., ERR_INFRA_UNAUTHORIZED, ERR_INFRA_DEPENDENCIES, etc. Extension may set these error codes in the .status.conditions[].codes[] list in case it makes sense. Gardener will pick them up and will similarly merge them into the .status.conditions[].codes[] list in the Shoot:\nstatus:conditions:- type:ControlPlaneHealthystatus:\u0026#34;False\u0026#34;reason:DeploymentUnhealthymessage: \u0026#39;Deployment cloud-controller-manager is unhealthy:condition\u0026#34;Available\u0026#34;hasinvalid status False (expected True) due to MinimumReplicasUnavailable:Deploymentdoesnothaveminimumavailability.\u0026#39;lastUpdateTime:\u0026#34;2014-05-25T12:44:27Z\u0026#34;codes:- ERR_INFRA_UNAUTHORIZED"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/documentation/contribute/10_code/10-contribution_guide/","title":"Contribution Guide","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Contributing to Gardener Code of conduct All members of the Gardener community must abide by the CNCF Code of Conduct.

At different point of this flow, it:\n deploys standard controlplane components such as kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, and kube-scheduler by creating the corresponding deployments, services, and other resources in the Shoot namespace. initiates the deployment of custom controlplane components by ControlPlane controllers by creating a ControlPlane resource in the Shoot namespace.  In order to apply any provider-specific changes to the configuration provided by Gardener for the standard controlplane components, cloud extension providers can install mutating admission webhooks for the resources created by Gardener in the Shoot namespace.\nWhat needs to be implemented to support a new cloud provider? In order to support a new cloud provider you should install \u0026ldquo;controlplane\u0026rdquo; mutating webhooks for any of the following resources:\n Deployment with name kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, or kube-scheduler StatefulSet with name etcd-main or etcd-events Service with name kube-apiserver OperatingSystemConfig with any name and purpose reconcile  See Contract Specification for more details on the contract that Gardener and webhooks should adhere to regarding the content of the above resources.\nYou can install 3 different kinds of controlplane webhooks:\n Shoot, or controlplane webhooks apply changes needed by the Shoot cloud provider, for example the --cloud-provider command line flag of kube-apiserver and kube-controller-manager. Such webhooks should only operate on Shoot namespaces labeled with shoot.gardener.cloud/provider=\u0026lt;provider\u0026gt;. Seed, or controlplaneexposure webhooks apply changes needed by the Seed cloud provider, for example annotations on the kube-apiserver service to ensure cloud-specific load balancers are correctly provisioned for a service of type LoadBalancer. Such webhooks should only operate on Shoot namespaces labeled with seed.gardener.cloud/provider=\u0026lt;provider\u0026gt;.  The labels shoot.gardener.cloud/provider and shoot.gardener.cloud/provider are added by Gardener when it creates the Shoot namespace.\nContract Specification This section specifies the contract that Gardener and webhooks should adhere to in order to ensure smooth interoperability. Note that this contract can\u0026rsquo;t be specified formally and is therefore easy to violate, especially by Gardener. The Gardener team will nevertheless do its best to adhere to this contract in the future and to ensure via additional measures (tests, validations) that it\u0026rsquo;s not unintentionally broken. If it needs to be changed intentionally, this can only happen after proper communication has taken place to ensure that the affected provider webhooks could be adapted to work with the new version of the contract.\nNote: The contract described below may not necessarily be what Gardener does currently (as of May 2019). Rather, it reflects the target state after changes for Gardener extensibility have been introduced.\nkube-apiserver To deploy kube-apiserver, Gardener shall create a deployment and a service both named kube-apiserver in the Shoot namespace. They can be mutated by webhooks to apply any provider-specific changes to the standard configuration provided by Gardener.\nThe pod template of the kube-apiserver deployment shall contain a container named kube-apiserver.\nThe command field of the kube-apiserver container shall contain the kube-apiserver command line. It shall contain a number of provider-independent flags that should be ignored by webhooks, such as:\n admission plugins (--enable-admission-plugins, --disable-admission-plugins) secure communications (--etcd-cafile, --etcd-certfile, --etcd-keyfile, \u0026hellip;) audit log (--audit-log-*) ports (--insecure-port, --secure-port)  The kube-apiserver command line shall not contain any provider-specific flags, such as:\n --cloud-provider --cloud-config  These flags can be added by webhooks if needed.\nThe kube-apiserver command line may contain a number of additional provider-independent flags. In general, webhooks should ignore these unless they are known to interfere with the desired kube-apiserver behavior for the specific provider. Among the flags to be considered are:\n --endpoint-reconciler-type --advertise-address --feature-gates  Gardener may use SNI to expose the apiserver (APIServerSNI feature gate). In this case, Gardener shall label the kube-apiserver's Deployment with core.gardener.cloud/apiserver-exposure: gardener-managed label and expects that the --endpoint-reconciler-type and --advertise-address flags are not modified.\nThe --enable-admission-plugins flag may contain admission plugins that are not compatible with CSI plugins such as PersistentVolumeLabel. Webhooks should therefore ensure that such admission plugins are either explicitly enabled (if CSI plugins are not used) or disabled (otherwise).\nThe env field of the kube-apiserver container shall not contain any provider-specific environment variables (so it will be empty). If any provider-specific environment variables are needed, they should be added by webhooks.\nThe volumes field of the pod template of the kube-apiserver deployment, and respectively the volumeMounts field of the kube-apiserver container shall not contain any provider-specific Secret or ConfigMap resources. If such resources should be mounted as volumes, this should be done by webhooks.\nThe kube-apiserver Service may be of type LoadBalancer, but shall not contain any provider-specific annotations that may be needed to actually provision a load balancer resource in the Seed provider\u0026rsquo;s cloud. If any such annotations are needed, they should be added by webhooks (typically controlplaneexposure webhooks).\nThe kube-apiserver Service shall be of type ClusterIP, if Gardener is using SNI to expose the apiserver (APIServerSNI feature gate). In this case, Gardener shall label this Service with core.gardener.cloud/apiserver-exposure: gardener-managed label and expects that no mutations happen.\nkube-controller-manager To deploy kube-controller-manager, Gardener shall create a deployment named kube-controller-manager in the Shoot namespace. It can be mutated by webhooks to apply any provider-specific changes to the standard configuration provided by Gardener.\nThe pod template of the kube-controller-manager deployment shall contain a container named kube-controller-manager.\nThe command field of the kube-controller-manager container shall contain the kube-controller-manager command line. It shall contain a number of provider-independent flags that should be ignored by webhooks, such as:\n --kubeconfig, --authentication-kubeconfig, --authorization-kubeconfig --leader-elect secure communications (--tls-cert-file, --tls-private-key-file, \u0026hellip;) cluster CIDR and identity (--cluster-cidr, --cluster-name) sync settings (--concurrent-deployment-syncs, --concurrent-replicaset-syncs) horizontal pod autoscaler (--horizontal-pod-autoscaler-*) ports (--port, --secure-port)  The kube-controller-manager command line shall not contain any provider-specific flags, such as:\n --cloud-provider --cloud-config --configure-cloud-routes --external-cloud-volume-plugin  These flags can be added by webhooks if needed.\nThe kube-controller-manager command line may contain a number of additional provider-independent flags. In general, webhooks should ignore these unless they are known to interfere with the desired kube-controller-manager behavior for the specific provider. Among the flags to be considered are:\n --feature-gates  The env field of the kube-controller-manager container shall not contain any provider-specific environment variables (so it will be empty). If any provider-specific environment variables are needed, they should be added by webhooks.\nThe volumes field of the pod template of the kube-controller-manager deployment, and respectively the volumeMounts field of the kube-controller-manager container shall not contain any provider-specific Secret or ConfigMap resources. If such resources should be mounted as volumes, this should be done by webhooks.\nkube-scheduler To deploy kube-scheduler, Gardener shall create a deployment named kube-scheduler in the Shoot namespace. It can be mutated by webhooks to apply any provider-specific changes to the standard configuration provided by Gardener.\nThe pod template of the kube-scheduler deployment shall contain a container named kube-scheduler.\nThe command field of the kube-scheduler container shall contain the kube-scheduler command line. It shall contain a number of provider-independent flags that should be ignored by webhooks, such as:\n --config --authentication-kubeconfig, --authorization-kubeconfig secure communications (--tls-cert-file, --tls-private-key-file, \u0026hellip;) ports (--port, --secure-port)  The kube-scheduler command line may contain additional provider-independent flags. In general, webhooks should ignore these unless they are known to interfere with the desired kube-controller-manager behavior for the specific provider. Among the flags to be considered are:\n --feature-gates  The kube-scheduler command line can\u0026rsquo;t contain provider-specific flags, and it makes no sense to specify provider-specific environment variables or mount provider-specific Secret or ConfigMap resources as volumes.\netcd-main and etcd-events To deploy etcd, Gardener shall create 2 StatefulSets named etcd-main and etcd-events in the Shoot namespace. They can be mutated by webhooks to apply any provider-specific changes to the standard configuration provided by Gardener.\nThe pod template of these 2 deployments shall contain a container named etcd. It shall not contain a sidecar container for etcd backups. If such a container is needed, it should be added by webhooks, together with any volumes it may need to mount.\nThe command field of the etcd container shall contain the etcd command line. It shall contain only provider-independent flags that should be ignored by webhooks. It can\u0026rsquo;t contain provider-specific flags, and it makes no sense to specify provider-specific environment variables or mount provider-specific Secret or ConfigMap resources as volumes.\nThe volumeClaimTemplates section of these 2 StatefulSets shall contain a template named etcd-main or etcd-events. This template shall use the default storage class. The corresponding claim is mounted into the etcd container at /var/etcd/data. If it is desirable to use a non-default storage class, this should be done by webhooks.\ncloud-controller-manager Gardener shall not deploy a cloud-controller-manager. If it is needed, it should be added by a ControlPlane controller\nCSI controllers Gardener shall not deploy a CSI controller. If it is needed, it should be added by a ControlPlane controller\nkubelet To specify the kubelet configuration, Gardener shall create a OperatingSystemConfig resource with any name and purpose reconcile in the Shoot namespace. It can therefore also be mutated by webhooks to apply any provider-specific changes to the standard configuration provided by Gardener. Gardener may write multiple such resources with different type to the same Shoot namespaces if multiple OSs are used.\nThe OSC resource shall contain a unit named kubelet.service, containing the corresponding systemd unit configuration file.

Note that this contract can\u0026rsquo;t be specified formally and is therefore easy to violate, especially by Gardener. The Gardener team will nevertheless do its best to adhere to this contract in the future and to ensure via additional measures (tests, validations) that it\u0026rsquo;s not unintentionally broken. If it needs to be changed intentionally, this can only happen after proper communication has taken place to ensure that the affected provider webhooks could be adapted to work with the new version of the contract.\nNote: The contract described below may not necessarily be what Gardener does currently (as of May 2019). Rather, it reflects the target state after changes for Gardener extensibility have been introduced.\nkube-apiserver To deploy kube-apiserver, Gardener shall create a deployment and a service both named kube-apiserver in the Shoot namespace. They can be mutated by webhooks to apply any provider-specific changes to the standard configuration provided by Gardener.\nThe pod template of the kube-apiserver deployment shall contain a container named kube-apiserver.\nThe command field of the kube-apiserver container shall contain the kube-apiserver command line.

Among the flags to be considered are:\n --endpoint-reconciler-type --advertise-address --feature-gates  Gardener may use SNI to expose the apiserver (APIServerSNI feature gate). In this case, Gardener shall label the kube-apiserver's Deployment with core.gardener.cloud/apiserver-exposure: gardener-managed label and expects that the --endpoint-reconciler-type and --advertise-address flags are not modified.\nThe --enable-admission-plugins flag may contain admission plugins that are not compatible with CSI plugins such as PersistentVolumeLabel. Webhooks should therefore ensure that such admission plugins are either explicitly enabled (if CSI plugins are not used) or disabled (otherwise).\nThe env field of the kube-apiserver container shall not contain any provider-specific environment variables (so it will be empty). If any provider-specific environment variables are needed, they should be added by webhooks.\nThe volumes field of the pod template of the kube-apiserver deployment, and respectively the volumeMounts field of the kube-apiserver container shall not contain any provider-specific Secret or ConfigMap resources.

If it is desirable to use a non-default storage class, this should be done by webhooks.\ncloud-controller-manager Gardener shall not deploy a cloud-controller-manager. If it is needed, it should be added by a ControlPlane controller\nCSI controllers Gardener shall not deploy a CSI controller. If it is needed, it should be added by a ControlPlane controller\nkubelet To specify the kubelet configuration, Gardener shall create a OperatingSystemConfig resource with any name and purpose reconcile in the Shoot namespace. It can therefore also be mutated by webhooks to apply any provider-specific changes to the standard configuration provided by Gardener. Gardener may write multiple such resources with different type to the same Shoot namespaces if multiple OSs are used.\nThe OSC resource shall contain a unit named kubelet.service, containing the corresponding systemd unit configuration file.

As mentioned in the controlplane customization webhooks document Gardener shall not deploy any cloud-controller-manager or any other provider-specific component. Instead, it creates a ControlPlane CRD that should be picked up by provider extensions. Its purpose is to trigger the deployment of such provider-specific components in the shoot namespace in the seed cluster.\nWhat needs to be implemented to support a new infrastructure provider? As part of the shoot flow Gardener will create a special CRD in the seed cluster that needs to be reconciled by an extension controller, for example:\n---apiVersion:extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:ControlPlanemetadata:name:control-planenamespace:shoot--foo--barspec:type:openstackregion:europe-west1secretRef:name:cloudprovidernamespace:shoot--foo--barproviderConfig:apiVersion:openstack.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:ControlPlaneConfigloadBalancerProvider:providerzone:eu-1acloudControllerManager:featureGates:CustomResourceValidation:trueinfrastructureProviderStatus:apiVersion:openstack.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:InfrastructureStatusnetworks:floatingPool:id:vpc-1234subnets:- purpose:nodesid:subnetidThe .spec.secretRef contains a reference to the provider secret pointing to the account that shall be used for the shoot cluster. However, the most important section is the .spec.providerConfig and the .spec.infrastructureProviderStatus. The first one contains an embedded declaration of the provider specific configuration for the control plane (that cannot be known by Gardener itself). You are responsible for designing how this configuration looks like. Gardener does not evaluate it but just copies this part from what has been provided by the end-user in the Shoot resource. The second one contains the output of the Infrastructure resource (that might be relevant for the CCM config).\nIn order to support a new control plane provider you need to write a controller that watches all ControlPlanes with .spec.type=\u0026lt;my-provider-name\u0026gt;. You can take a look at the below referenced example implementation for the Alicloud provider.\nThe control plane controller as part of the ControlPlane reconciliation, often deploys resources (e.g. pods/deployments) into the Shoot namespace in the Seed as part of its ControlPlane reconciliation loop. Because the namespace contains network policies that per default deny all ingress and egress traffic, the pods may need to have proper labels matching to the selectors of the network policies in order to allow the required network traffic. Otherwise, they won\u0026rsquo;t be allowed to talk to certain other components (e.g., the kube-apiserver of the shoot). Please see this document for more information.\nNon-provider specific information required for infrastructure creation Most providers might require further information that is not provider specific but already part of the shoot resource. One example for this is the GCP control plane controller which needs the Kubernetes version of the shoot cluster (because it already uses the in-tree Kubernetes cloud-controller-manager). As Gardener cannot know which information is required by providers it simply mirrors the Shoot, Seed, and CloudProfile resources into the seed. They are part of the Cluster extension resource and can be used to extract information that is not part of the Infrastructure resource itself.\nReferences and additional resources  ControlPlane API (Golang specification) Exemplary implementation for the Alicloud provider  "},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/documentation/concepts/extensions/controlplane-exposure/","title":"ControlPlane resource with purpose exposure","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Contract: ControlPlane resource with purpose exposure Some Kubernetes clusters require an additional deployments required by the seed cloud provider in order to work properly, e.g. AWS Load Balancer Readvertiser.

In order to execute the existing tests, you can use\nmake test # runs tests make verify # runs static code checks and test There is an additional command for analyzing the code coverage of the tests. Ginkgo will generate standard Golang cover profiles which will be translated into a HTML file by the Go Cover Tool. Another command helps you to clean up the filesystem from the temporary cover profile files and the HTML report:\nmake test-cov open gardener.coverage.html make test-cov-clean sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime env test Some of the integration tests in Gardener are using the sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/envtest package. It sets up a temporary control plane (etcd + kube-apiserver) against the integration tests can run. The test and test-cov rules in the Makefile prepare this env test automatically by downloading the respective binaries (if not yet present) and set the necessary environment variables.\nYou can also run go test or ginkgo without the test/test-cov rules. In this case you have to set the KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS environment variable to the path that contains the etcd + kube-apiserver binaries or you need to have the binaries pre-installed under /usr/local/kubebuilder/bin.\nDependency Management We are using go modules for depedency management.

This deployment requires admin privileges. The Helm chart contains a service account gardenlet that the gardenlet deployment uses by default to talk to the Seed API server.\n If the gardenlet isn’t deployed in the seed cluster, the gardenlet can be configured to use a kubeconfig, which also requires full admin rights, from a mounted directory. The kubeconfig is specified in section seedClientConnection.kubeconfig of the Gardenlet configuration. This configuration option isn’t used in the following,\nas this procedure only describes the recommended setup option where the gardenlet is running in the seed cluster itself.\n Procedure Overview   Prepare the garden cluster:\n Create a bootstrap token secret in the kube-system namespace of the garden cluster Create RBAC roles for the gardenlet to allow bootstrapping in the garden cluster    Prepare the gardenlet Helm chart.\n  Automatically register shoot cluster as a seed cluster.\n  Deploy the gardenlet\n  Check that the gardenlet is successfully deployed\n  Create a bootstrap token secret in the kube-system namespace of the garden cluster The gardenlet needs to talk to the Gardener API server residing in the garden cluster.\nThe gardenlet can be configured with an already existing garden cluster kubeconfig in one of the following ways:\n  Either by specifying gardenClientConnection.kubeconfig in the Gardenlet configuration or\n  by supplying the environment variable GARDEN_KUBECONFIG pointing to a mounted kubeconfig file).\n  The preferred way however, is to use the gardenlets ability to request a signed certificate for the garden cluster by leveraging Kubernetes Certificate Signing Requests. The gardenlet performs a TLS bootstrapping process that is similar to the Kubelet TLS Bootstrapping. Make sure that the API server of the garden cluster has bootstrap token authentication enabled.\nThe client credentials required for the gardenlets TLS bootstrapping process, need to be either token or certificate (OIDC isn’t supported) and have permissions to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). It’s recommended to use bootstrap tokens due to their desirable security properties (such as a limited token lifetime).\nTherefore, first create a bootstrap token secret for the garden cluster:\napiVersion:v1kind:Secretmetadata:# Name MUST be of form \u0026#34;bootstrap-token-\u0026lt;token id\u0026gt;\u0026#34;name:bootstrap-token-07401bnamespace:kube-system# Type MUST be \u0026#39;bootstrap.kubernetes.io/token\u0026#39;type:bootstrap.kubernetes.io/tokenstringData:# Human readable description.

Additionally, when using the control plane chart, the following resources are already contained in the Helm chart, that is, if you use it you can skip these steps as the needed RBAC roles already exist.\nThe gardenlet uses the configured bootstrap kubeconfig in gardenClientConnection.bootstrapKubeconfig to request a signed certificate for the user gardener.cloud:system:seed:\u0026lt;seed-name\u0026gt; in the group gardener.cloud:system:seeds.\nCreate a ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding that grant full admin permissions to authenticated gardenlets.\nCreate the following resources in the garden cluster:\n---apiVersion:rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1kind:ClusterRolemetadata:name:gardener.cloud:system:seedsrules:- apiGroups:- \u0026#39;*\u0026#39;resources:- \u0026#39;*\u0026#39;verbs:- \u0026#39;*\u0026#39;---apiVersion:rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1kind:ClusterRoleBindingmetadata:name:gardener.cloud:system:seedsroleRef:apiGroup:rbac.authorization.k8s.iokind:ClusterRolename:gardener.cloud:system:seedssubjects:- kind:Groupname:gardener.cloud:system:seedsapiGroup:rbac.authorization.k8s.ioPrepare the gardenlet Helm chart This section only describes the minimal configuration, using the global configuration values of the gardenlet Helm chart. For an overview over all values, see the configuration values.

For more information, see:\n Example Seed resource Configurable Seed settings.   Adjust the gardenlet component configuration   Supply the Seed resource in section seedConfig of your gardenlet configuration gardenlet-values.yaml.\n Note that with the seedConfig supplied, the gardenlet is only responsible to create and reconcile this one configured seed (in the previous example: sweet-seed). The gardenlet can also be configured to reconcile (but not create!) multiple Seeds based on a label selector, which is only recommended for a development setup.\n   Add the seedConfig to your gardenlet configuration gardenlet-values.yaml. The field seedConfig.spec.provider.type specifies the infrastructure provider type (for example, aws) of the seed cluster.

Make sure to obtain client credentials that have sufficient permissions with the chosen storage provider.\nCreate a secret in the garden cluster with client credentials for the storage provider. The format of the secret is cloud provider specific and can be found in the repository of the respective Gardener extension. For example, the secret for AWS S3 can be found in the AWS provider extension (30-etcd-backup-secret.yaml).\napiVersion:v1kind:Secretmetadata:name:sweet-seed-backupnamespace:gardentype:Opaquedata:# client credentials format is provider specificConfigure the Seed resource in section seedConfig of your gardenlet configuration to use backup and restore:\n...seedConfig:metadata:name:sweet-seedspec:backup:provider:\u0026lt;provider\u0026gt; secretRef:name:sweet-seed-backupnamespace:gardenDeploy the gardenlet  The gardenlet doesn’t have to run in the same Kubernetes cluster as the seed cluster it’s registering and reconciling, but it is in most cases advantageous to use in-cluster communication to talk to the Seed API server.

(The gardenlet is not restricted to run in the seed cluster or to be deployed into a Kubernetes cluster at all).\n   Once you’ve deployed a gardenlet manually, for example, behind a firewall, you can deploy new gardenlets automatically. The manually deployed gardenlet is then used as a template for the new gardenlets. More information: Automatic Deployment of Gardenlets.\n Prerequisites Kubernetes cluster that should be registered as a seed cluster   Verify that the cluster has a supported Kubernetes version.\n  Determine the nodes, pods, and services CIDR of the cluster. You need to configure this information in the Seed configuration. Gardener uses this information to check that the shoot cluster isn’t created with overlapping CIDR ranges.\n  Every Seed cluster needs an Ingress controller which distributes external requests to internal components like grafana and prometheus. Gardener supports two approaches to achieve this:\n  a. Gardener managed Ingress controller and DNS records. For this configure the following lines in your Seed resource:\nspec:dns:provider:type:aws-route53secretRef:name:ingress-secretnamespace:gardeningress:domain:ingress.my-seed.example.comcontroller:kind:nginxproviderConfig:\u0026lt;some-optional-provider-specific-config-for-the-ingressController\u0026gt;⚠ Please note that if you set .spec.ingress then .spec.dns.ingressDomain must be nil.\nb.

This deployment requires admin privileges. The Helm chart contains a service account gardenlet that the gardenlet deployment uses by default to talk to the Seed API server.\n If the gardenlet isn’t deployed in the seed cluster, the gardenlet can be configured to use a kubeconfig, which also requires full admin rights, from a mounted directory. The kubeconfig is specified in section seedClientConnection.kubeconfig of the Gardenlet configuration. This configuration option isn’t used in the following,\nas this procedure only describes the recommended setup option where the gardenlet is running in the seed cluster itself.\n Procedure Overview   Prepare the garden cluster:\n Create a bootstrap token secret in the kube-system namespace of the garden cluster Create RBAC roles for the gardenlet to allow bootstrapping in the garden cluster    Prepare the gardenlet Helm chart.\n  Automatically register shoot cluster as a seed cluster.\n  Deploy the gardenlet\n  Check that the gardenlet is successfully deployed\n  Create a bootstrap token secret in the kube-system namespace of the garden cluster The gardenlet needs to talk to the Gardener API server residing in the garden cluster.\nThe gardenlet can be configured with an already existing garden cluster kubeconfig in one of the following ways:\n  Either by specifying gardenClientConnection.kubeconfig in the Gardenlet configuration or\n  by supplying the environment variable GARDEN_KUBECONFIG pointing to a mounted kubeconfig file).\n  The preferred way however, is to use the gardenlets ability to request a signed certificate for the garden cluster by leveraging Kubernetes Certificate Signing Requests. The gardenlet performs a TLS bootstrapping process that is similar to the Kubelet TLS Bootstrapping. Make sure that the API server of the garden cluster has bootstrap token authentication enabled.\nThe client credentials required for the gardenlets TLS bootstrapping process, need to be either token or certificate (OIDC isn’t supported) and have permissions to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). It’s recommended to use bootstrap tokens due to their desirable security properties (such as a limited token lifetime).\nTherefore, first create a bootstrap token secret for the garden cluster:\napiVersion:v1kind:Secretmetadata:# Name MUST be of form \u0026#34;bootstrap-token-\u0026lt;token id\u0026gt;\u0026#34;name:bootstrap-token-07401bnamespace:kube-system# Type MUST be \u0026#39;bootstrap.kubernetes.io/token\u0026#39;type:bootstrap.kubernetes.io/tokenstringData:# Human readable description.

So, we use a Route53 Hosted Zone even if we are deploying on Azure.\nAWS credentials for Route 53 Hosted Zone You need to provide credentials for AWS with permission to access Route53 Hosted Zone. In this example we\u0026rsquo;ll assume your domain for the Hosted Zone is .your.domain.here.\nHOSTED_ZONE_ID= # place your AWS Route53 hostedZoneID here Create an AWS user, define policy to allow permission for the Hosted Zone and note the hostedZoneID, accessKeyID and secretAccessKey for later use.\nDeploy AKS cluster Here you can find a summary for creating an AKS cluster, if you already have one, skip this step.\naz group create --name garden-1 --location eastus az aks create --resource-group garden-1 --name garden-1 \\ --kubernetes-version 1.11.5 \\ --node-count 2 --node-vm-size Standard_DS4_v2 \\ --generate-ssh-keys az aks get-credentials --resource-group garden-1 --name garden-1 --admin Initialize Helm on the Cluster Since RBAC is enabled by default we need to deploy helm with an RBAC config.\nkubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/helm-charts/master/docs/prerequisities/helm-rbac-config.yaml helm init --service-account tiller Deploy stable/nginx-ingress chart to AKS At the moment the Ingress resources created by the Gardener are expecting the nginx-ingress style annotations to work.\nhelm upgrade --install \\ --namespace kube-system \\ nginx-ingress stable/nginx-ingress Create wildcard DNS record for the ingress You need to pick a wildcard subdomain matching your Route53 Hosted Zone here. This ingress wildcard record is supposed to be part of the Seed cluster rather than Gardener cluster, in our example we\u0026rsquo;ll use *.seed-1.your.domain.here.\nAssuming you have the AWS cli for your Route53 Hosted Zone is configured on your local, here we\u0026rsquo;ll create the wildcard DNS record using the awless.

You can install gardenctl following instruction in its repo: https://github.com/gardener/gardenctl\nHere is a sample configuration for gardenctl:\n$ cat ~/.garden/config gardenClusters: - name: dev kubeConfig: ~/.kube/config Install Gardener Create garden namespace This is where we deploy Gardener components.\nkubectl apply -f example/00-namespace-garden.yaml Deploy etcd Since Gardener is an extension API Server, it can share the etcd backing native Kubernetes cluster\u0026rsquo;s API Server, and hence explicit etcd installation is optional. But in our case we have no access to the control plane components of the AKS cluster and we have to deploy our own etcd ourselves for Gardener. Lets deploy an etcd using the gardener/etcd-backup-restore project, which is also used by the Gardener for Shoot control plane.\n# pull the etcd-backup-restore git clone https://github.com/gardener/etcd-backup-restore.git # deploy etcd helm upgrade --install \\ --namespace garden \\ etcd etcd-backup-restore/chart \\ --set tls= Note: This etcd installation doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide HA. But etcd will be auto recovered by the Deployment. This could be sufficient for some deployments but may not be suitable for production usage. Also note that this etcd is not deployed with TLS enabled and doesn\u0026rsquo;t use certificates for authentication.\nCheck etcd pod\u0026rsquo;s health, it should have READY:2/2 and STATUS:Running:\n$ kubectl -n garden get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE etcd-for-test-0 2/2 Running 0 1m Deploy Gardener Helm Chart Check (current releases)[https://github.com/gardener/gardener/releases] and pick a suitable one to install.\nGARDENER_RELEASE=0.17.1 gardener-controller-manager will need to maintain some DNS records for Seed. So, you need to provide Route53 credentials in the values.yaml file:\n global.controller.internalDomain.hostedZoneID global.controller.internalDomain.domain: Here pick a subdomain for your Gardener to maintain DNS records for your Shoot clusters.

You may not want to use apiserver.insecureSkipTLSVerify=true, the hardcoded apiserver certificates, and insecure (non-tls enabled) etcd. But for the sake of keeping this example simple you can just keep those values as they are.\nCreate a CloudProfile We need to create a CloudProfile to be referred from the Shoot (example/30-cloudprofile-azure.yaml):\nkubectl apply -f example/30-cloudprofile-azure.yaml Validate that CloudProfile is created:\nkubectl describe -f example/30-cloudprofile-azure.yaml Define Seed cluster in Gardener In our setup we\u0026rsquo;ll use the cluster for Gardener also as a Seed, this saves us from creating a new Kubernetes cluster. But you can also create an explicit cluster for the Seed. Seed cluster can also be placed into any other cloud provider or on prem. But keep in mind that below steps may differ if you use a different cluster for seed.\nCurrently, a Seed cluster is just a Kubeconfig for the Gardener. The seed cluster could have been created by any tool, Gardener only cares about having a valid Kubeconfig to talk to its API.\nCreate the Seed resource definition with its Secret Lets start with the required seed secret first. Here we need to provide it\u0026rsquo;s cloud provider credentials and kubeconfig in the seed secret. Update example/40-secret-seed-azure.yaml and place the secrets for your environment:\n data.subscriptionID: you can learn this one with az account show data.tenantID: from az ad sp create-for-rbac output as you can see above data.clientID: from az ad sp create-for-rbac output as you can see above data.clientSecret: from az ad sp create-for-rbac output as you can see above data.kubeconfig: you can get this one with az aks get-credentials --resource-group garden-1 --name garden-1 -f - | base64)  Note: All of the above values must be base64 encoded.

A project in Gardener terminology is simply a namespace that holds group of Shoots, during this example we\u0026rsquo;ll deploy a single Shoot. (Mind the extra labels defined in example/00-namespace-garden-dev.yaml).\nkubectl apply -f example/05-project-dev.yaml You can check the projects via gardenctl:\n$ gardenctl target garden dev $ kubectl get project dev NAME NAMESPACE STATUS OWNER CREATOR AGE dev garden-dev Ready john.doe@example.com client 1m $ kubectl get ns garden-dev NAME STATUS AGE garden-dev Active 1m $ gardenctl ls projects projects: - project: garden-dev Create a SecretBinding and related Secret We\u0026rsquo;ll use same Azure credentials with example/40-secret-seed-azure.yaml, this is due to the fact that we use the same Azure Subscription for the Shoot and Seed clusters.

So, we use a Route53 Hosted Zone even if we are deploying on Azure.\nAWS credentials for Route 53 Hosted Zone You need to provide credentials for AWS with permission to access Route53 Hosted Zone.

You can install gardenctl following instruction in its repo: https://github.com/gardener/gardenctl\nHere is a sample configuration for gardenctl:\n$ cat ~/.garden/config gardenClusters: - name: dev kubeConfig: ~/.kube/config Install Gardener Create garden namespace This is where we deploy Gardener components.\nkubectl apply -f example/00-namespace-garden.yaml Deploy etcd Since Gardener is an extension API Server, it can share the etcd backing native Kubernetes cluster\u0026rsquo;s API Server, and hence explicit etcd installation is optional. But in our case we have no access to the control plane components of the AKS cluster and we have to deploy our own etcd ourselves for Gardener. Lets deploy an etcd using the gardener/etcd-backup-restore project, which is also used by the Gardener for Shoot control plane.\n# pull the etcd-backup-restore git clone https://github.com/gardener/etcd-backup-restore.git # deploy etcd helm upgrade --install \\ --namespace garden \\ etcd etcd-backup-restore/chart \\ --set tls= Note: This etcd installation doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide HA. But etcd will be auto recovered by the Deployment. This could be sufficient for some deployments but may not be suitable for production usage.

But you can also create an explicit cluster for the Seed. Seed cluster can also be placed into any other cloud provider or on prem. But keep in mind that below steps may differ if you use a different cluster for seed.\nCurrently, a Seed cluster is just a Kubeconfig for the Gardener. The seed cluster could have been created by any tool, Gardener only cares about having a valid Kubeconfig to talk to its API.\nCreate the Seed resource definition with its Secret Lets start with the required seed secret first. Here we need to provide it\u0026rsquo;s cloud provider credentials and kubeconfig in the seed secret.

So, we use a Route53 Hosted Zone even if we are deploying on Azure.\nAWS credentials for Route 53 Hosted Zone You need to provide credentials for AWS with permission to access Route53 Hosted Zone. In this example we\u0026rsquo;ll assume your domain for the Hosted Zone is .your.domain.here.\nHOSTED_ZONE_ID= # place your AWS Route53 hostedZoneID here Create an AWS user, define policy to allow permission for the Hosted Zone and note the hostedZoneID, accessKeyID and secretAccessKey for later use.\nDeploy AKS cluster Here you can find a summary for creating an AKS cluster, if you already have one, skip this step.\naz group create --name garden-1 --location eastus az aks create --resource-group garden-1 --name garden-1 \\ --kubernetes-version 1.11.5 \\ --node-count 2 --node-vm-size Standard_DS4_v2 \\ --generate-ssh-keys az aks get-credentials --resource-group garden-1 --name garden-1 --admin Initialize Helm on the Cluster Since RBAC is enabled by default we need to deploy helm with an RBAC config.\nkubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/helm-charts/master/docs/prerequisities/helm-rbac-config.yaml helm init --service-account tiller Deploy stable/nginx-ingress chart to AKS At the moment the Ingress resources created by the Gardener are expecting the nginx-ingress style annotations to work.\nhelm upgrade --install \\ --namespace kube-system \\ nginx-ingress stable/nginx-ingress Create wildcard DNS record for the ingress You need to pick a wildcard subdomain matching your Route53 Hosted Zone here. This ingress wildcard record is supposed to be part of the Seed cluster rather than Gardener cluster, in our example we\u0026rsquo;ll use *.seed-1.your.domain.here.\nAssuming you have the AWS cli for your Route53 Hosted Zone is configured on your local, here we\u0026rsquo;ll create the wildcard DNS record using the awless. You can also use the AWS console or any other tool of your choice to create the wildcard record:\nHOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN=$(aws route53 get-hosted-zone --id /hostedzone/${HOSTED_ZONE_ID:?\u0026#34;HOSTED_ZONE_ID is missing\u0026#34;} --query \u0026#39;HostedZone.Name\u0026#39; --output text) INGRESS_DOMAIN=\u0026#34;seed-1.${HOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN%%.}\u0026#34; # Get LB IP address from `kubectl -n kube-system get svc shared-ingress-nginx-ingress-controller` LB_IP=$(kubectl -n kube-system get svc nginx-ingress-controller --template \u0026#39;{{(index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0).ip}}\u0026#39;) awless create record \\ zone=$HOSTED_ZONE_ID \\ name=\u0026#34;*.$INGRESS_DOMAIN\u0026#34; \\ value=$LB_IP \\ type=A \\ ttl=300 Create Azure Service Principle to get Azure credentials We need client_id and client_secret to allow Gardener to reach Azure services, we can generate a pair by creating a Service Principle on Azure:\n$ az ad sp create-for-rbac --role=\u0026#34;Contributor\u0026#34; Retrying role assignment creation: 1/36 { \u0026#34;appId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;xxxxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxx\u0026#34;, #az_client_id \u0026#34;displayName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;azure-cli-2018-05-23-16-15-49\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://azure-cli-2018-05-23-16-15-49\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;password\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;xxxxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxx\u0026#34;, #az_client_secret \u0026#34;tenant\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;xxxxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxx\u0026#34; #az_tenant_id } Let\u0026rsquo;s define some env variables for later use\nCLIENT_ID= # place your Azure Service Principal appId CLIENT_SECRET= # place your Azure Service Principal password here Install gardenctl In this example we\u0026rsquo;ll be using gardenctl to interact with Gardener. You can install gardenctl following instruction in its repo: https://github.com/gardener/gardenctl\nHere is a sample configuration for gardenctl:\n$ cat ~/.garden/config gardenClusters: - name: dev kubeConfig: ~/.kube/config Install Gardener Create garden namespace This is where we deploy Gardener components.\nkubectl apply -f example/00-namespace-garden.yaml Deploy etcd Since Gardener is an extension API Server, it can share the etcd backing native Kubernetes cluster\u0026rsquo;s API Server, and hence explicit etcd installation is optional. But in our case we have no access to the control plane components of the AKS cluster and we have to deploy our own etcd ourselves for Gardener. Lets deploy an etcd using the gardener/etcd-backup-restore project, which is also used by the Gardener for Shoot control plane.\n# pull the etcd-backup-restore git clone https://github.com/gardener/etcd-backup-restore.git # deploy etcd helm upgrade --install \\ --namespace garden \\ etcd etcd-backup-restore/chart \\ --set tls= Note: This etcd installation doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide HA. But etcd will be auto recovered by the Deployment. This could be sufficient for some deployments but may not be suitable for production usage. Also note that this etcd is not deployed with TLS enabled and doesn\u0026rsquo;t use certificates for authentication.\nCheck etcd pod\u0026rsquo;s health, it should have READY:2/2 and STATUS:Running:\n$ kubectl -n garden get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE etcd-for-test-0 2/2 Running 0 1m Deploy Gardener Helm Chart Check (current releases)[https://github.com/gardener/gardener/releases] and pick a suitable one to install.\nGARDENER_RELEASE=0.17.1 gardener-controller-manager will need to maintain some DNS records for Seed. So, you need to provide Route53 credentials in the values.yaml file:\n global.controller.internalDomain.hostedZoneID global.controller.internalDomain.domain: Here pick a subdomain for your Gardener to maintain DNS records for your Shoot clusters.

You may not want to use apiserver.insecureSkipTLSVerify=true, the hardcoded apiserver certificates, and insecure (non-tls enabled) etcd. But for the sake of keeping this example simple you can just keep those values as they are.\nCreate a CloudProfile We need to create a CloudProfile to be referred from the Shoot (example/30-cloudprofile-azure.yaml):\nkubectl apply -f example/30-cloudprofile-azure.yaml Validate that CloudProfile is created:\nkubectl describe -f example/30-cloudprofile-azure.yaml Define Seed cluster in Gardener In our setup we\u0026rsquo;ll use the cluster for Gardener also as a Seed, this saves us from creating a new Kubernetes cluster. But you can also create an explicit cluster for the Seed. Seed cluster can also be placed into any other cloud provider or on prem. But keep in mind that below steps may differ if you use a different cluster for seed.\nCurrently, a Seed cluster is just a Kubeconfig for the Gardener. The seed cluster could have been created by any tool, Gardener only cares about having a valid Kubeconfig to talk to its API.\nCreate the Seed resource definition with its Secret Lets start with the required seed secret first. Here we need to provide it\u0026rsquo;s cloud provider credentials and kubeconfig in the seed secret. Update example/40-secret-seed-azure.yaml and place the secrets for your environment:\n data.subscriptionID: you can learn this one with az account show data.tenantID: from az ad sp create-for-rbac output as you can see above data.clientID: from az ad sp create-for-rbac output as you can see above data.clientSecret: from az ad sp create-for-rbac output as you can see above data.kubeconfig: you can get this one with az aks get-credentials --resource-group garden-1 --name garden-1 -f - | base64)  Note: All of the above values must be base64 encoded.

A project in Gardener terminology is simply a namespace that holds group of Shoots, during this example we\u0026rsquo;ll deploy a single Shoot. (Mind the extra labels defined in example/00-namespace-garden-dev.yaml).\nkubectl apply -f example/05-project-dev.yaml You can check the projects via gardenctl:\n$ gardenctl target garden dev $ kubectl get project dev NAME NAMESPACE STATUS OWNER CREATOR AGE dev garden-dev Ready john.doe@example.com client 1m $ kubectl get ns garden-dev NAME STATUS AGE garden-dev Active 1m $ gardenctl ls projects projects: - project: garden-dev Create a SecretBinding and related Secret We\u0026rsquo;ll use same Azure credentials with example/40-secret-seed-azure.yaml, this is due to the fact that we use the same Azure Subscription for the Shoot and Seed clusters.

So, we use a Route53 Hosted Zone even if we are deploying on Azure.\nAWS credentials for Route 53 Hosted Zone You need to provide credentials for AWS with permission to access Route53 Hosted Zone. In this example we\u0026rsquo;ll assume your domain for the Hosted Zone is .your.domain.here.\nHOSTED_ZONE_ID= # place your AWS Route53 hostedZoneID here Create an AWS user, define policy to allow permission for the Hosted Zone and note the hostedZoneID, accessKeyID and secretAccessKey for later use.\nDeploy AKS cluster Here you can find a summary for creating an AKS cluster, if you already have one, skip this step.\naz group create --name garden-1 --location eastus az aks create --resource-group garden-1 --name garden-1 \\ --kubernetes-version 1.11.5 \\ --node-count 2 --node-vm-size Standard_DS4_v2 \\ --generate-ssh-keys az aks get-credentials --resource-group garden-1 --name garden-1 --admin Initialize Helm on the Cluster Since RBAC is enabled by default we need to deploy helm with an RBAC config.\nkubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/helm-charts/master/docs/prerequisities/helm-rbac-config.yaml helm init --service-account tiller Deploy stable/nginx-ingress chart to AKS At the moment the Ingress resources created by the Gardener are expecting the nginx-ingress style annotations to work.\nhelm upgrade --install \\ --namespace kube-system \\ nginx-ingress stable/nginx-ingress Create wildcard DNS record for the ingress You need to pick a wildcard subdomain matching your Route53 Hosted Zone here. This ingress wildcard record is supposed to be part of the Seed cluster rather than Gardener cluster, in our example we\u0026rsquo;ll use *.seed-1.your.domain.here.\nAssuming you have the AWS cli for your Route53 Hosted Zone is configured on your local, here we\u0026rsquo;ll create the wildcard DNS record using the awless. You can also use the AWS console or any other tool of your choice to create the wildcard record:\nHOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN=$(aws route53 get-hosted-zone --id /hostedzone/${HOSTED_ZONE_ID:?\u0026#34;HOSTED_ZONE_ID is missing\u0026#34;} --query \u0026#39;HostedZone.Name\u0026#39; --output text) INGRESS_DOMAIN=\u0026#34;seed-1.${HOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN%%.}\u0026#34; # Get LB IP address from `kubectl -n kube-system get svc shared-ingress-nginx-ingress-controller` LB_IP=$(kubectl -n kube-system get svc nginx-ingress-controller --template \u0026#39;{{(index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0).ip}}\u0026#39;) awless create record \\ zone=$HOSTED_ZONE_ID \\ name=\u0026#34;*.$INGRESS_DOMAIN\u0026#34; \\ value=$LB_IP \\ type=A \\ ttl=300 Create Azure Service Principle to get Azure credentials We need client_id and client_secret to allow Gardener to reach Azure services, we can generate a pair by creating a Service Principle on Azure:\n$ az ad sp create-for-rbac --role=\u0026#34;Contributor\u0026#34; Retrying role assignment creation: 1/36 { \u0026#34;appId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;xxxxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxx\u0026#34;, #az_client_id \u0026#34;displayName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;azure-cli-2018-05-23-16-15-49\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://azure-cli-2018-05-23-16-15-49\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;password\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;xxxxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxx\u0026#34;, #az_client_secret \u0026#34;tenant\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;xxxxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxx\u0026#34; #az_tenant_id } Let\u0026rsquo;s define some env variables for later use\nCLIENT_ID= # place your Azure Service Principal appId CLIENT_SECRET= # place your Azure Service Principal password here Install gardenctl In this example we\u0026rsquo;ll be using gardenctl to interact with Gardener. You can install gardenctl following instruction in its repo: https://github.com/gardener/gardenctl\nHere is a sample configuration for gardenctl:\n$ cat ~/.garden/config gardenClusters: - name: dev kubeConfig: ~/.kube/config Install Gardener Create garden namespace This is where we deploy Gardener components.\nkubectl apply -f example/00-namespace-garden.yaml Deploy etcd Since Gardener is an extension API Server, it can share the etcd backing native Kubernetes cluster\u0026rsquo;s API Server, and hence explicit etcd installation is optional. But in our case we have no access to the control plane components of the AKS cluster and we have to deploy our own etcd ourselves for Gardener. Lets deploy an etcd using the gardener/etcd-backup-restore project, which is also used by the Gardener for Shoot control plane.\n# pull the etcd-backup-restore git clone https://github.com/gardener/etcd-backup-restore.git # deploy etcd helm upgrade --install \\ --namespace garden \\ etcd etcd-backup-restore/chart \\ --set tls= Note: This etcd installation doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide HA. But etcd will be auto recovered by the Deployment. This could be sufficient for some deployments but may not be suitable for production usage. Also note that this etcd is not deployed with TLS enabled and doesn\u0026rsquo;t use certificates for authentication.\nCheck etcd pod\u0026rsquo;s health, it should have READY:2/2 and STATUS:Running:\n$ kubectl -n garden get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE etcd-for-test-0 2/2 Running 0 1m Deploy Gardener Helm Chart Check current releases and pick a suitable one to install.\nGARDENER_RELEASE=0.17.1 gardener-controller-manager will need to maintain some DNS records for Seed. So, you need to provide Route53 credentials in the values.yaml file:\n global.controller.internalDomain.hostedZoneID global.controller.internalDomain.domain: Here pick a subdomain for your Gardener to maintain DNS records for your Shoot clusters. This domain has to be within your Route53 Hosted Zone. e.g. garden-1.your.domain.here global.controller.internalDomain.credentials global.controller.internalDomain.secretAccessKey  HOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN=$( aws route53 get-hosted-zone \\ --id /hostedzone/${HOSTED_ZONE_ID:?\u0026#34;HOSTED_ZONE_ID is missing\u0026#34;} \\ --query \u0026#39;HostedZone.Name\u0026#39; \\ --output text) HOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN=${HOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN%%.} GARDENER_DOMAIN=\u0026#34;garden-1.${HOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN}\u0026#34; ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(aws configure get aws_access_key_id) SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(aws configure get aws_secret_access_key) cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF \u0026gt; gardener-values.yaml global: apiserver: image: tag: ${GARDENER_RELEASE:?\u0026#34;GARDENER_RELEASE is missing\u0026#34;} etcd: servers: http://etcd-for-test-client:2379 useSidecar: false controller: image: tag: ${GARDENER_RELEASE:?\u0026#34;GARDENER_RELEASE is missing\u0026#34;} internalDomain: provider: aws-route53 hostedZoneID: ${HOSTED_ZONE_ID} domain: ${HOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN} credentials: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${ACCESS_KEY_ID} AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${SECRET_ACCESS_KEY} EOF After creating the gardener-values.yaml file, since chart definition in master branch can have breaking changes after the release, checkout the gardener tag for that release, and run:\ngit checkout ${GARDENER_RELEASE:?\u0026#34;GARDENER_RELEASE is missing\u0026#34;} helm upgrade --install \\ --namespace garden \\ garden charts/gardener \\ -f charts/gardener/local-values.yaml \\ -f gardener-values.yaml Validate the Gardener is deployed:\nhelm status garden # Wait for `STATUS: DEPLOYED` kubectl -n garden get deploy,pod -l app=gardener # Better if you leave two terminals open in for below commands, and # keep an eye on whats going on behind the scenes as you create/delete # Gardener specific resources (Seed, CloudProfile, SecretBinding, Shoot). kubectl -n garden logs -f deployment/gardener-apiserver # confirm no issues kubectl -n garden logs -f deployment/gardener-controller-manager # confirm no issues, except some \u0026#34;Failed to list *v1beta1...\u0026#34; messages Note: This is not meant to be used in production. You may not want to use apiserver.insecureSkipTLSVerify=true, the hardcoded apiserver certificates, and insecure (non-tls enabled) etcd. But for the sake of keeping this example simple you can just keep those values as they are.\nCreate a CloudProfile We need to create a CloudProfile to be referred from the Shoot (example/30-cloudprofile-azure.yaml):\nkubectl apply -f example/30-cloudprofile-azure.yaml Validate that CloudProfile is created:\nkubectl describe -f example/30-cloudprofile-azure.yaml Define Seed cluster in Gardener In our setup we\u0026rsquo;ll use the cluster for Gardener also as a Seed, this saves us from creating a new Kubernetes cluster. But you can also create an explicit cluster for the Seed. Seed cluster can also be placed into any other cloud provider or on prem. But keep in mind that below steps may differ if you use a different cluster for seed.\nCurrently, a Seed cluster is just a Kubeconfig for the Gardener. The seed cluster could have been created by any tool, Gardener only cares about having a valid Kubeconfig to talk to its API.\nCreate the Seed resource definition with its Secret Lets start with the required seed secret first. Here we need to provide it\u0026rsquo;s cloud provider credentials and kubeconfig in the seed secret. Update example/40-secret-seed-azure.yaml and place the secrets for your environment:\n data.subscriptionID: you can learn this one with az account show data.tenantID: from az ad sp create-for-rbac output as you can see above data.clientID: from az ad sp create-for-rbac output as you can see above data.clientSecret: from az ad sp create-for-rbac output as you can see above data.kubeconfig: you can get this one with az aks get-credentials --resource-group garden-1 --name garden-1 -f - | base64)  Note: All of the above values must be base64 encoded.

A project in Gardener terminology is simply a namespace that holds group of Shoots, during this example we\u0026rsquo;ll deploy a single Shoot. (Mind the extra labels defined in example/00-namespace-garden-dev.yaml).\nkubectl apply -f example/05-project-dev.yaml You can check the projects via gardenctl:\n$ gardenctl target garden dev $ kubectl get project dev NAME NAMESPACE STATUS OWNER CREATOR AGE dev garden-dev Ready john.doe@example.com client 1m $ kubectl get ns garden-dev NAME STATUS AGE garden-dev Active 1m $ gardenctl ls projects projects: - project: garden-dev Create a SecretBinding and related Secret We\u0026rsquo;ll use same Azure credentials with example/40-secret-seed-azure.yaml, this is due to the fact that we use the same Azure Subscription for the Shoot and Seed clusters.

So, we use a Route53 Hosted Zone even if we are deploying on Azure.\nAWS credentials for Route 53 Hosted Zone You need to provide credentials for AWS with permission to access Route53 Hosted Zone.

You can install gardenctl following instruction in its repo: https://github.com/gardener/gardenctl\nHere is a sample configuration for gardenctl:\n$ cat ~/.garden/config gardenClusters: - name: dev kubeConfig: ~/.kube/config Install Gardener Create garden namespace This is where we deploy Gardener components.\nkubectl apply -f example/00-namespace-garden.yaml Deploy etcd Since Gardener is an extension API Server, it can share the etcd backing native Kubernetes cluster\u0026rsquo;s API Server, and hence explicit etcd installation is optional. But in our case we have no access to the control plane components of the AKS cluster and we have to deploy our own etcd ourselves for Gardener. Lets deploy an etcd using the gardener/etcd-backup-restore project, which is also used by the Gardener for Shoot control plane.\n# pull the etcd-backup-restore git clone https://github.com/gardener/etcd-backup-restore.git # deploy etcd helm upgrade --install \\ --namespace garden \\ etcd etcd-backup-restore/chart \\ --set tls= Note: This etcd installation doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide HA. But etcd will be auto recovered by the Deployment. This could be sufficient for some deployments but may not be suitable for production usage.

But keep in mind that below steps may differ if you use a different cluster for seed.\nCurrently, a Seed cluster is just a Kubeconfig for the Gardener. The seed cluster could have been created by any tool, Gardener only cares about having a valid Kubeconfig to talk to its API.\nCreate the Seed resource definition with its Secret Lets start with the required seed secret first.

So, we use a Route53 Hosted Zone even if we are deploying on Azure.\nAWS credentials for Route 53 Hosted Zone You need to provide credentials for AWS with permission to access Route53 Hosted Zone. In this example we\u0026rsquo;ll assume your domain for the Hosted Zone is .your.domain.here.\nHOSTED_ZONE_ID= # place your AWS Route53 hostedZoneID here Create an AWS user, define policy to allow permission for the Hosted Zone and note the hostedZoneID, accessKeyID and secretAccessKey for later use.\nDeploy AKS cluster Here you can find a summary for creating an AKS cluster, if you already have one, skip this step.\naz group create --name garden-1 --location eastus az aks create --resource-group garden-1 --name garden-1 \\ --kubernetes-version 1.11.5 \\ --node-count 2 --node-vm-size Standard_DS4_v2 \\ --generate-ssh-keys az aks get-credentials --resource-group garden-1 --name garden-1 --admin Initialize Helm on the Cluster Since RBAC is enabled by default we need to deploy helm with an RBAC config.\nkubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/helm-charts/master/docs/prerequisities/helm-rbac-config.yaml helm init --service-account tiller Deploy stable/nginx-ingress chart to AKS At the moment the Ingress resources created by the Gardener are expecting the nginx-ingress style annotations to work.\nhelm upgrade --install \\ --namespace kube-system \\ nginx-ingress stable/nginx-ingress Create wildcard DNS record for the ingress You need to pick a wildcard subdomain matching your Route53 Hosted Zone here. This ingress wildcard record is supposed to be part of the Seed cluster rather than Gardener cluster, in our example we\u0026rsquo;ll use *.seed-1.your.domain.here.\nAssuming you have the AWS cli for your Route53 Hosted Zone is configured on your local, here we\u0026rsquo;ll create the wildcard DNS record using the awless. You can also use the AWS console or any other tool of your choice to create the wildcard record:\nHOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN=$(aws route53 get-hosted-zone --id /hostedzone/${HOSTED_ZONE_ID:?\u0026#34;HOSTED_ZONE_ID is missing\u0026#34;} --query \u0026#39;HostedZone.Name\u0026#39; --output text) INGRESS_DOMAIN=\u0026#34;seed-1.${HOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN%%.}\u0026#34; # Get LB IP address from `kubectl -n kube-system get svc shared-ingress-nginx-ingress-controller` LB_IP=$(kubectl -n kube-system get svc nginx-ingress-controller --template \u0026#39;{{(index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0).ip}}\u0026#39;) awless create record \\ zone=$HOSTED_ZONE_ID \\ name=\u0026#34;*.$INGRESS_DOMAIN\u0026#34; \\ value=$LB_IP \\ type=A \\ ttl=300 Create Azure Service Principle to get Azure credentials We need client_id and client_secret to allow Gardener to reach Azure services, we can generate a pair by creating a Service Principle on Azure:\n$ az ad sp create-for-rbac --role=\u0026#34;Contributor\u0026#34; Retrying role assignment creation: 1/36 { \u0026#34;appId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;xxxxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxx\u0026#34;, #az_client_id \u0026#34;displayName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;azure-cli-2018-05-23-16-15-49\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://azure-cli-2018-05-23-16-15-49\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;password\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;xxxxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxx\u0026#34;, #az_client_secret \u0026#34;tenant\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;xxxxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxx\u0026#34; #az_tenant_id } Let\u0026rsquo;s define some env variables for later use\nCLIENT_ID= # place your Azure Service Principal appId CLIENT_SECRET= # place your Azure Service Principal password here Install gardenctl In this example we\u0026rsquo;ll be using gardenctl to interact with Gardener. You can install gardenctl following instruction in its repo: https://github.com/gardener/gardenctl\nHere is a sample configuration for gardenctl:\n$ cat ~/.garden/config gardenClusters: - name: dev kubeConfig: ~/.kube/config Install Gardener Create garden namespace This is where we deploy Gardener components.\nkubectl apply -f example/00-namespace-garden.yaml Deploy etcd Since Gardener is an extension API Server, it can share the etcd backing native Kubernetes cluster\u0026rsquo;s API Server, and hence explicit etcd installation is optional. But in our case we have no access to the control plane components of the AKS cluster and we have to deploy our own etcd ourselves for Gardener. Lets deploy an etcd using the gardener/etcd-backup-restore project, which is also used by the Gardener for Shoot control plane.\n# pull the etcd-backup-restore git clone https://github.com/gardener/etcd-backup-restore.git # deploy etcd helm upgrade --install \\ --namespace garden \\ etcd etcd-backup-restore/chart \\ --set tls= Note: This etcd installation doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide HA. But etcd will be auto recovered by the Deployment. This could be sufficient for some deployments but may not be suitable for production usage. Also note that this etcd is not deployed with TLS enabled and doesn\u0026rsquo;t use certificates for authentication.\nCheck etcd pod\u0026rsquo;s health, it should have READY:2/2 and STATUS:Running:\n$ kubectl -n garden get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE etcd-for-test-0 2/2 Running 0 1m Deploy Gardener Helm Chart Check current releases and pick a suitable one to install.\nGARDENER_RELEASE=0.17.1 gardener-controller-manager will need to maintain some DNS records for Seed. So, you need to provide Route53 credentials in the values.yaml file:\n global.controller.internalDomain.hostedZoneID global.controller.internalDomain.domain: Here pick a subdomain for your Gardener to maintain DNS records for your Shoot clusters. This domain has to be within your Route53 Hosted Zone. e.g. garden-1.your.domain.here global.controller.internalDomain.credentials global.controller.internalDomain.secretAccessKey  HOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN=$( aws route53 get-hosted-zone \\ --id /hostedzone/${HOSTED_ZONE_ID:?\u0026#34;HOSTED_ZONE_ID is missing\u0026#34;} \\ --query \u0026#39;HostedZone.Name\u0026#39; \\ --output text) HOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN=${HOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN%%.} GARDENER_DOMAIN=\u0026#34;garden-1.${HOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN}\u0026#34; ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(aws configure get aws_access_key_id) SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(aws configure get aws_secret_access_key) cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF \u0026gt; gardener-values.yaml global: apiserver: image: tag: ${GARDENER_RELEASE:?\u0026#34;GARDENER_RELEASE is missing\u0026#34;} etcd: servers: http://etcd-for-test-client:2379 useSidecar: false controller: image: tag: ${GARDENER_RELEASE:?\u0026#34;GARDENER_RELEASE is missing\u0026#34;} internalDomain: provider: aws-route53 hostedZoneID: ${HOSTED_ZONE_ID} domain: ${HOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN} credentials: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${ACCESS_KEY_ID} AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${SECRET_ACCESS_KEY} EOF After creating the gardener-values.yaml file, since chart definition in master branch can have breaking changes after the release, checkout the gardener tag for that release, and run:\ngit checkout ${GARDENER_RELEASE:?\u0026#34;GARDENER_RELEASE is missing\u0026#34;} helm upgrade --install \\ --namespace garden \\ garden charts/gardener \\ -f charts/gardener/local-values.yaml \\ -f gardener-values.yaml Validate the Gardener is deployed:\nhelm status garden # Wait for `STATUS: DEPLOYED` kubectl -n garden get deploy,pod -l app=gardener # Better if you leave two terminals open in for below commands, and # keep an eye on whats going on behind the scenes as you create/delete # Gardener specific resources (Seed, CloudProfile, SecretBinding, Shoot). kubectl -n garden logs -f deployment/gardener-apiserver # confirm no issues kubectl -n garden logs -f deployment/gardener-controller-manager # confirm no issues, except some \u0026#34;Failed to list *v1beta1...\u0026#34; messages Note: This is not meant to be used in production. You may not want to use apiserver.insecureSkipTLSVerify=true, the hardcoded apiserver certificates, and insecure (non-tls enabled) etcd. But for the sake of keeping this example simple you can just keep those values as they are.\nCreate a CloudProfile We need to create a CloudProfile to be referred from the Shoot (example/30-cloudprofile-azure.yaml):\nkubectl apply -f example/30-cloudprofile-azure.yaml Validate that CloudProfile is created:\nkubectl describe -f example/30-cloudprofile-azure.yaml Define Seed cluster in Gardener In our setup we\u0026rsquo;ll use the cluster for Gardener also as a Seed, this saves us from creating a new Kubernetes cluster. But you can also create an explicit cluster for the Seed. Seed cluster can also be placed into any other cloud provider or on prem. But keep in mind that below steps may differ if you use a different cluster for seed.\nCurrently, a Seed cluster is just a Kubeconfig for the Gardener. The seed cluster could have been created by any tool, Gardener only cares about having a valid Kubeconfig to talk to its API.\nCreate the Seed resource definition with its Secret Lets start with the required seed secret first. Here we need to provide it\u0026rsquo;s cloud provider credentials and kubeconfig in the seed secret. Update example/40-secret-seed-azure.yaml and place the secrets for your environment:\n data.subscriptionID: you can learn this one with az account show data.tenantID: from az ad sp create-for-rbac output as you can see above data.clientID: from az ad sp create-for-rbac output as you can see above data.clientSecret: from az ad sp create-for-rbac output as you can see above data.kubeconfig: you can get this one with az aks get-credentials --resource-group garden-1 --name garden-1 -f - | base64)  Note: All of the above values must be base64 encoded.

A project in Gardener terminology is simply a namespace that holds group of Shoots, during this example we\u0026rsquo;ll deploy a single Shoot. (Mind the extra labels defined in example/00-namespace-garden-dev.yaml).\nkubectl apply -f example/05-project-dev.yaml You can check the projects via gardenctl:\n$ gardenctl target garden dev $ kubectl get project dev NAME NAMESPACE STATUS OWNER CREATOR AGE dev garden-dev Ready john.doe@example.com client 1m $ kubectl get ns garden-dev NAME STATUS AGE garden-dev Active 1m $ gardenctl ls projects projects: - project: garden-dev Create a SecretBinding and related Secret We\u0026rsquo;ll use same Azure credentials with example/40-secret-seed-azure.yaml, this is due to the fact that we use the same Azure Subscription for the Shoot and Seed clusters.

The management of these DNS records requires provider-specific knowledge which is to be developed outside of the Gardener\u0026rsquo;s core repository.\nWhat does Gardener create DNS records for? Internal domain name Every shoot cluster\u0026rsquo;s kube-apiserver running in the seed is exposed via a load balancer that has a public endpoint (IP or hostname). This endpoint is used by end-users and also by system components (that are running in another network, e.g., the kubelet or kube-proxy) to talk to the cluster. In order to be robust against changes of this endpoint (e.g., caused due to re-creation of the load balancer or move of the control plane to another seed cluster) Gardener creates a so-called internal domain name for every shoot cluster. The internal domain name is a publicly resolvable DNS record that points to the load balancer of the kube-apiserver. Gardener uses this domain name in the kubeconfigs of all system components (instead of writing the load balancer endpoint directly into it. This way Gardener does not need to recreate all the kubeconfigs if the endpoint changes - it just needs to update the DNS record.\nExternal domain name The internal domain name is not configurable by end-users directly but dictated by the Gardener administrator. However, end-users usually prefer to have another DNS name, maybe even using their own domain sometimes to access their Kubernetes clusters. Gardener supports that by creating another DNS record, named external domain name, that actually points to the internal domain name. The kubeconfig handed out to end-users does contain this external domain name, i.e., users can access their clusters with the DNS name they like to.\nAs not every end-user has an own domain it is possible for Gardener administrators to configure so-called default domains. If configured, shoots that do not specify a domain explicitly get an external domain name based on a default domain (unless explicitly stated that this shoot should not get an external domain name (.spec.dns.provider=unmanaged).\nDomain name for ingress (deprecated) Gardener allows to deploy a nginx-ingress-controller into a shoot cluster (deprecated). This controller is exposed via a public load balancer (again, either IP or hostname). Gardener creates a wildcard DNS record pointing to this load balancer. Ingress resources can later use this wildcard DNS record to expose underlying applications.\nWhat needs to be implemented to support a new DNS provider? As part of the shoot flow Gardener will create two special resources in the seed cluster that need to be reconciled by an extension controller. The first resource (DNSProvider) is a declaration of a DNS provider (e.g., aws-route53, google-clouddns, \u0026hellip;) with a reference to a Secret object that contains the provider-specific credentials in order to talk to the provider\u0026rsquo;s API. It also allows to specify two lists of domains that shall be allowed or disallowed to be used for DNS entries:\n---apiVersion:v1kind:Secretmetadata:name:aws-credentialsnamespace:defaulttype:Opaquedata:# aws-route53 specific credentials here---apiVersion:dns.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:DNSProvidermetadata:name:my-aws-accountnamespace:defaultspec:type:aws-route53secretRef:name:aws-credentialsdomains:include:- dev.my-fancy-domain.comexclude:- staging.my-fancy-domain.com- prod.my-fancy-domain.comWhen reconciling this resource the DNS controller has to read information about available DNS zones to figure out which domains can actually be supported by the provided credentials. Based on the constraints given in the DNSProvider resources .spec.domains.{include|exclude} fields it shall later only allow certain DNS entries. Gardener waits until the status indicates that the registration went well:\napiVersion:dns.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:DNSProvider...status:state:Readymessage:everythingokOther possible states are Pending, Error, and Invalid.

The management of these DNS records requires provider-specific knowledge which is to be developed outside of the Gardener\u0026rsquo;s core repository.\nWhat does Gardener create DNS records for? Internal domain name Every shoot cluster\u0026rsquo;s kube-apiserver running in the seed is exposed via a load balancer that has a public endpoint (IP or hostname). This endpoint is used by end-users and also by system components (that are running in another network, e.g., the kubelet or kube-proxy) to talk to the cluster. In order to be robust against changes of this endpoint (e.g., caused due to re-creation of the load balancer or move of the control plane to another seed cluster) Gardener creates a so-called internal domain name for every shoot cluster. The internal domain name is a publicly resolvable DNS record that points to the load balancer of the kube-apiserver. Gardener uses this domain name in the kubeconfigs of all system components (instead of writing the load balancer endpoint directly into it. This way Gardener does not need to recreate all the kubeconfigs if the endpoint changes - it just needs to update the DNS record.\nExternal domain name The internal domain name is not configurable by end-users directly but dictated by the Gardener administrator. However, end-users usually prefer to have another DNS name, maybe even using their own domain sometimes to access their Kubernetes clusters. Gardener supports that by creating another DNS record, named external domain name, that actually points to the internal domain name. The kubeconfig handed out to end-users does contain this external domain name, i.e., users can access their clusters with the DNS name they like to.\nAs not every end-user has an own domain it is possible for Gardener administrators to configure so-called default domains. If configured, shoots that do not specify a domain explicitly get an external domain name based on a default domain (unless explicitly stated that this shoot should not get an external domain name (.spec.dns.provider=unmanaged).\nDomain name for ingress (deprecated) Gardener allows to deploy a nginx-ingress-controller into a shoot cluster (deprecated). This controller is exposed via a public load balancer (again, either IP or hostname). Gardener creates a wildcard DNS record pointing to this load balancer. Ingress resources can later use this wildcard DNS record to expose underlying applications.\nWhat needs to be implemented to support a new DNS provider? As part of the shoot flow Gardener will create two special resources in the seed cluster that need to be reconciled by an extension controller. The first resource (DNSProvider) is a declaration of a DNS provider (e.g., aws-route53, google-clouddns, \u0026hellip;) with a reference to a Secret object that contains the provider-specific credentials in order to talk to the provider\u0026rsquo;s API. It also allows to specify two lists of domains that shall be allowed or disallowed to be used for DNS entries:\n---apiVersion:v1kind:Secretmetadata:name:aws-credentialsnamespace:defaulttype:Opaquedata:# aws-route53 specific credentials here---apiVersion:dns.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:DNSProvidermetadata:name:my-aws-accountnamespace:defaultspec:type:aws-route53secretRef:name:aws-credentialsdomains:include:- dev.my-fancy-domain.comexclude:- staging.my-fancy-domain.com- prod.my-fancy-domain.comWhen reconciling this resource the DNS controller has to read information about available DNS zones to figure out which domains can actually be supported by the provided credentials. Based on the constraints given in the DNSProvider resources .spec.domains.{include|exclude} fields it shall later only allow certain DNS entries. Gardener waits until the status indicates that the registration went well:\napiVersion:dns.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:DNSProvider...status:state:Readymessage:everythingokOther possible states are Pending, Error, and Invalid.

The API server extends the Kubernetes API via the user-aggregated API server concepts. However, if you want to develop it, you may want to work locally with the Gardener without building a Docker image and deploying it to a cluster each and every time. That means that the Gardener runs outside a Kubernetes cluster which requires providing a Kubeconfig in your local filesystem and point the Gardener to it when starting it (see below).\nFurther details could be found in\n Principles of Kubernetes, and its components Kubernetes Development Guide Architecture of Gardener  This setup is based on minikube, a Kubernetes cluster running on a single node. Docker for Desktop and kind are also supported.\nInstalling Golang environment Install latest version of Golang. For MacOS you could use Homebrew:\nbrew install golang For other OS, please check Go installation documentation.\nInstalling kubectl and helm As already mentioned in the introduction, the communication with the Gardener happens via the Kubernetes (Garden) cluster it is targeting. To interact with that cluster, you need to install kubectl. Please make sure that the version of kubectl is at least v1.11.x.\nOn MacOS run\nbrew install kubernetes-cli Please check the kubectl installation documentation for other OS.\nYou may also need to develop Helm charts or interact with Tiller using the Helm CLI:\nOn MacOS run\nbrew install kubernetes-helm On other OS please check the Helm installation documentation.\nInstalling git We use git as VCS which you need to install.\nOn MacOS run\nbrew install git On other OS, please check the Git installation documentation.\nInstalling openvpn We use OpenVPN to establish network connectivity from the control plane running in the Seed cluster to the Shoot\u0026rsquo;s worker nodes running in private networks. To harden the security we need to generate another secret to encrypt the network traffic (details). Please install the openvpn binary. On MacOS run\nbrew install openvpn export PATH=$(brew --prefix openvpn)/sbin:$PATH On other OS, please check the OpenVPN downloads page.\nInstalling Minikube You\u0026rsquo;ll need to have minikube installed and running.\n Note: Gardener is working only with self-contained kubeconfig files because of security issue. You can configure your minikube to create self-contained kubeconfig files via:\nminikube config set embed-certs true  Alternatively, you can also install Docker for Desktop and kind.\nIn case you want to use the \u0026ldquo;Docker for Mac Kubernetes\u0026rdquo; or if you want to build Docker images for the Gardener you have to install Docker itself. On MacOS, please use Docker for MacOS which can be downloaded here.\nOn other OS, please check the Docker installation documentation.\nInstalling iproute2 iproute2 provides a collection of utilities for network administration and configuration.\nOn MacOS run\nbrew install iproute2mac Installing yaml2json and jq go get -u github.com/bronze1man/yaml2json brew install jq [MacOS only] Install GNU core utilities When running on MacOS you have to install the GNU core utilities:\nbrew install coreutils gnu-sed This will create symbolic links for the GNU utilities with g prefix in /usr/local/bin, e.g., gsed or gbase64. To allow using them without the g prefix please put /usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin at the beginning of your PATH environment variable, e.g., export PATH=/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH.\n[Windows] WSL2 Apart from Linux distributions and MacOS, the local gardener setup can also run on the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2.\nWhile WSL1, plain docker for windows and various Linux distributions and local Kubernetes environments may be supported, this setup was verified with:\n WSL2 Docker Desktop WSL2 Engine Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on WSL2 Nodeless local garden (see below)  The Gardener repository and all the above-mentioned tools (git, golang, kubectl, \u0026hellip;) should be installed in your WSL2 distro, according to the distribution-specific Linux installation instructions.\n[Optional] Installing gcloud SDK In case you have to create a new release or a new hotfix of the Gardener you have to push the resulting Docker image into a Docker registry. Currently, we are using the Google Container Registry (this could change in the future). Please follow the official installation instructions from Google.\nLocal Gardener setup This setup is only meant to be used for developing purposes, which means that only the control plane of the Gardener cluster is running on your machine.\nGet the sources Clone the repository from GitHub.\ngit clone git@github.com:gardener/gardener.git cd gardener Start the Gardener :warning: Before you start developing, please ensure to comply with the following requirements:\n You have understood the principles of Kubernetes, and its components, what their purpose is and how they interact with each other. You have understood the architecture of Gardener, and what the various clusters are used for.  Start a local kubernetes cluster For the development of Gardener you need some kind of Kubernetes cluster, which can be used as a \u0026ldquo;garden\u0026rdquo; cluster. I.e. you need a Kubernetes API server on which you can register a APIService Gardener\u0026rsquo;s own Extension API Server.\nFor this you can use a standard tool from the community to setup a local cluster like minikube, kind or the Kubernetes Cluster feature in Docker for Desktop.\nHowever, if you develop and run Gardener\u0026rsquo;s components locally, you don\u0026rsquo;t actually a fully fledged Kubernetes Cluster, i.e. you don\u0026rsquo;t actually need to run Pods on it. If you want to use a more lightweight approach for development purposes, you can use the \u0026ldquo;nodeless Garden cluster setup\u0026rdquo; residing in hack/local-garden. This is the easiest way to get your Gardener development setup up and running.\nUsing the nodeless cluster setup\nSetting up a local nodeless Garden cluster is quite simple. The only prerequisite is a running docker daemon. Just use the provided Makefile rules to start your local Garden:\nmake local-garden-up [...] Starting gardener-dev kube-etcd cluster..! Starting gardener-dev kube-apiserver..! Starting gardener-dev kube-controller-manager..! Starting gardener-dev gardener-etcd cluster..! namespace/garden created clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/gardener.cloud:admin created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/front-proxy-client created [...] This will start all minimally required components of a Kubernetes cluster (etcd, kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager) and an etcd Instance for the gardener-apiserver as Docker containers.\nTo tear down the local Garden cluster and remove the Docker containers, simply run:\nmake local-garden-down Using minikube\nAlternatively, spin up a cluster with minikube with this command:\nminikube start --embed-certs # `--embed-certs` can be omitted if minikube has already been set to create self-contained kubeconfig files. 😄 minikube v1.8.2 on Darwin 10.15.3 🔥 Creating virtualbox VM (CPUs=2, Memory=2048MB, Disk=20000MB) ... [...] 🏄 Done! Thank you for using minikube! Prepare the Gardener Now, that you have started your local cluster, we can go ahead and register the Gardener API Server. Just point your KUBECONFIG environment variable to the local cluster you created in the previous step and run:\nmake dev-setup Found Minikube ... namespace/garden created namespace/garden-dev created deployment.apps/etcd created service/etcd created service/gardener-apiserver created service/gardener-controller-manager created endpoints/gardener-apiserver created endpoints/gardener-controller-manager created apiservice.apiregistration.k8s.io/v1alpha1.core.gardener.cloud created apiservice.apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1.core.gardener.cloud created validatingwebhookconfiguration.admissionregistration.k8s.io/gardener-controller-manager created Optionally, you can switch off the Logging feature gate of Gardenlet to save resources:\nsed -i -e \u0026#39;s/Logging: true/Logging: false/g\u0026#39; dev/20-componentconfig-gardenlet.yaml The Gardener exposes the API servers of Shoot clusters via Kubernetes services of type LoadBalancer. In order to establish stable endpoints (robust against changes of the load balancer address), it creates DNS records pointing to these load balancer addresses. They are used internally and by all cluster components to communicate. You need to have control over a domain (or subdomain) for which these records will be created.

Also, please refer to this document for further information about how extensions are registered in case you want to use other versions than the latest releases.\nThe Gardener should now be ready to operate on Shoot resources. You can use\nkubectl get shoots No resources found. to operate against your local running Gardener API Server.\n Note: It may take several seconds until the minikube cluster recognizes that the Gardener API server has been started and is available. No resources found is the expected result of our initial development setup.\n Limitations of local development setup You can run Gardener (API server, controller manager, scheduler, gardenlet) against any local Kubernetes cluster, however, your seed and shoot clusters must be deployed to a \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; provider. Currently, it is not possible to run Gardener entirely isolated from any cloud provider. We are planning to support a setup that can run completely locally (see this for details), however, it does not yet exist. This means that - after you have setup Gardener - you need to register an external seed cluster (e.g., one created in AWS). Only after that step you can start creating shoot clusters with your locally running Gardener.\nSome time ago, we had a local setup based on VirtualBox/Vagrant. However, as we have progressed with the Extensibility epic we noticed that this implementation/setup does no longer fit into how we envision external providers to be. Moreover, it hid too many things and came with a bunch of limitations, making the development scenario too \u0026ldquo;artificial\u0026rdquo;:\n No integration with machine-controller-manager. The Shoot API Server is exposed via a NodePort. In a cloud setup a LoadBalancer would be used. It was not possible to create Shoot clusters consisting of more than one worker node. Cluster auto-scaling therefore is not supported. It was not possible to create two or more Shoot clusters in parallel. The communication between the Seed and the Shoot Clusters uses VPN tunnel. In this setup tunnels are not needed since all components run on localhost.  Additional information To make sure that a specific Seed cluster will be chosen, specify the .spec.seedName field (see here for an example Shoot manifest).\nPlease take a look at the example manifests folder to see which resource objects you need to install into your Garden cluster.\nAppendix Configure Seed clusters for local development When using the Gardenlet in a local development scenario with make start-gardenlet then the Gardenlet component configuration is setup with a seed selector that targets all available Seed clusters. However, a Seed resource needs to be configured to allow being reconciled by a Gardenlet which such a configuration.\nWhen deploying the Gardenlet to reconcile only one Seed cluster (using component configuration .seedConfig), the Gardenlet either needs to be supplied with a kubeconfig for the particular Seed cluster, or acquires one via bootstrapping. Having said that, if the Gardenlet is configured to manage multiple Seed clusters based on a label selector, it needs to fetch the kubeconfig of each Seed cluster at runtime from somewhere. That is why the Seed resource needs to be configured with an additional secret reference that contains the kubeconfig of the Seed cluster.\nCreate a secret containing the base64 encoded kubeconfig of the Seed cluster (the scope of the permissions should be identical to the kubeconfig that the Gardenlet creates during bootstrapping - for now, cluster-admin privileges are recommended).\nCreate the secret in the Garden cluster:\napiVersion:v1kind:Secretmetadata:name:sweet-seednamespace:gardentype:Opaquedata:kubeconfig:\u0026lt;base64-seed-kubeconfig\u0026gt;.Adjust the Seed resource to reference the secret in spec.secretRef like so:\napiVersion:core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1kind:Seedmetadata:name:my-sweet-seedspec:...secretRef:name:sweet-seednamespace:garden"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/v1.12.8/contribute/10_code/13_env/","title":"Environment","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Preparing the Setup Conceptually, all Gardener components are designated to run inside as a Pod inside a Kubernetes cluster. The API server extends the Kubernetes API via the user-aggregated API server concepts. However, if you want to develop it, you may want to work locally with the Gardener without building a Docker image and deploying it to a cluster each and every time. That means that the Gardener runs outside a Kubernetes cluster which requires providing a Kubeconfig in your local filesystem and point the Gardener to it when starting it (see below).\nFurther details could be found in\n Principles of Kubernetes, and its components Kubernetes Development Guide Architecture of Gardener  This setup is based on minikube, a Kubernetes cluster running on a single node. Docker for Desktop and kind are also supported.\nInstalling Golang environment Install latest version of Golang. For MacOS you could use Homebrew:\nbrew install golang For other OS, please check Go installation documentation.\nInstalling kubectl and helm As already mentioned in the introduction, the communication with the Gardener happens via the Kubernetes (Garden) cluster it is targeting. To interact with that cluster, you need to install kubectl. Please make sure that the version of kubectl is at least v1.11.x.\nOn MacOS run\nbrew install kubernetes-cli Please check the kubectl installation documentation for other OS.\nYou may also need to develop Helm charts or interact with Tiller using the Helm CLI:\nOn MacOS run\nbrew install kubernetes-helm On other OS please check the Helm installation documentation.\nInstalling git We use git as VCS which you need to install.\nOn MacOS run\nbrew install git On other OS, please check the Git installation documentation.\nInstalling openvpn We use OpenVPN to establish network connectivity from the control plane running in the Seed cluster to the Shoot\u0026rsquo;s worker nodes running in private networks. To harden the security we need to generate another secret to encrypt the network traffic (details). Please install the openvpn binary. On MacOS run\nbrew install openvpn export PATH=$(brew --prefix openvpn)/sbin:$PATH On other OS, please check the OpenVPN downloads page.\nInstalling Minikube You\u0026rsquo;ll need to have minikube installed and running.\n Note: Gardener is working only with self-contained kubeconfig files because of security issue. You can configure your minikube to create self-contained kubeconfig files via:\nminikube config set embed-certs true  Alternatively, you can also install Docker for Desktop and kind.\nIn case you want to use the \u0026ldquo;Docker for Mac Kubernetes\u0026rdquo; or if you want to build Docker images for the Gardener you have to install Docker itself. On MacOS, please use Docker for MacOS which can be downloaded here.\nOn other OS, please check the Docker installation documentation.\nInstalling iproute2 iproute2 provides a collection of utilities for network administration and configuration.\nOn MacOS run\nbrew install iproute2mac Installing yaml2json and jq go get -u github.com/bronze1man/yaml2json brew install jq [MacOS only] Install GNU core utilities When running on MacOS you have to install the GNU core utilities:\nbrew install coreutils gnu-sed This will create symbolic links for the GNU utilities with g prefix in /usr/local/bin, e.g., gsed or gbase64. To allow using them without the g prefix please put /usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin at the beginning of your PATH environment variable, e.g., export PATH=/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH.\n[Windows] WSL2 Apart from Linux distributions and MacOS, the local gardener setup can also run on the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2.\nWhile WSL1, plain docker for windows and various Linux distributions and local Kubernetes environments may be supported, this setup was verified with:\n WSL2 Docker Desktop WSL2 Engine Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on WSL2 Nodeless local garden (see below)  The Gardener repository and all the above-mentioned tools (git, golang, kubectl, \u0026hellip;) should be installed in your WSL2 distro, according to the distribution-specific Linux installation instructions.\n[Optional] Installing gcloud SDK In case you have to create a new release or a new hotfix of the Gardener you have to push the resulting Docker image into a Docker registry. Currently, we are using the Google Container Registry (this could change in the future). Please follow the official installation instructions from Google.\nLocal Gardener setup This setup is only meant to be used for developing purposes, which means that only the control plane of the Gardener cluster is running on your machine.\nGet the sources Clone the repository from GitHub.\ngit clone git@github.com:gardener/gardener.git cd gardener Start the Gardener :warning: Before you start developing, please ensure to comply with the following requirements:\n You have understood the principles of Kubernetes, and its components, what their purpose is and how they interact with each other. You have understood the architecture of Gardener, and what the various clusters are used for.  Start a local kubernetes cluster For the development of Gardener you need some kind of Kubernetes cluster, which can be used as a \u0026ldquo;garden\u0026rdquo; cluster. I.e. you need a Kubernetes API server on which you can register a APIService Gardener\u0026rsquo;s own Extension API Server.\nFor this you can use a standard tool from the community to setup a local cluster like minikube, kind or the Kubernetes Cluster feature in Docker for Desktop.\nHowever, if you develop and run Gardener\u0026rsquo;s components locally, you don\u0026rsquo;t actually a fully fledged Kubernetes Cluster, i.e. you don\u0026rsquo;t actually need to run Pods on it. If you want to use a more lightweight approach for development purposes, you can use the \u0026ldquo;nodeless Garden cluster setup\u0026rdquo; residing in hack/local-garden. This is the easiest way to get your Gardener development setup up and running.\nUsing the nodeless cluster setup\nSetting up a local nodeless Garden cluster is quite simple. The only prerequisite is a running docker daemon. Just use the provided Makefile rules to start your local Garden:\nmake local-garden-up [...] Starting gardener-dev kube-etcd cluster..! Starting gardener-dev kube-apiserver..! Starting gardener-dev kube-controller-manager..! Starting gardener-dev gardener-etcd cluster..! namespace/garden created clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/gardener.cloud:admin created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/front-proxy-client created [...] This will start all minimally required components of a Kubernetes cluster (etcd, kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager) and an etcd Instance for the gardener-apiserver as Docker containers.\nTo tear down the local Garden cluster and remove the Docker containers, simply run:\nmake local-garden-down Using minikube\nAlternatively, spin up a cluster with minikube with this command:\nminikube start --embed-certs # `--embed-certs` can be omitted if minikube has already been set to create self-contained kubeconfig files. 😄 minikube v1.8.2 on Darwin 10.15.3 🔥 Creating virtualbox VM (CPUs=2, Memory=2048MB, Disk=20000MB) ... [...] 🏄 Done! Thank you for using minikube! Prepare the Gardener Now, that you have started your local cluster, we can go ahead and register the Gardener API Server. Just point your KUBECONFIG environment variable to the local cluster you created in the previous step and run:\nmake dev-setup Found Minikube ... namespace/garden created namespace/garden-dev created deployment.apps/etcd created service/etcd created service/gardener-apiserver created service/gardener-controller-manager created endpoints/gardener-apiserver created endpoints/gardener-controller-manager created apiservice.apiregistration.k8s.io/v1alpha1.core.gardener.cloud created apiservice.apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1.core.gardener.cloud created validatingwebhookconfiguration.admissionregistration.k8s.io/gardener-controller-manager created Optionally, you can switch off the Logging feature gate of Gardenlet to save resources:\nsed -i -e \u0026#39;s/Logging: true/Logging: false/g\u0026#39; dev/20-componentconfig-gardenlet.yaml The Gardener exposes the API servers of Shoot clusters via Kubernetes services of type LoadBalancer. In order to establish stable endpoints (robust against changes of the load balancer address), it creates DNS records pointing to these load balancer addresses. They are used internally and by all cluster components to communicate. You need to have control over a domain (or subdomain) for which these records will be created. Please provide an internal domain secret (see this for an example) which contains credentials with the proper privileges.

Moreover, it hid too many things and came with a bunch of limitations, making the development scenario too \u0026ldquo;artificial\u0026rdquo;:\n No integration with machine-controller-manager. The Shoot API Server is exposed via a NodePort. In a cloud setup a LoadBalancer would be used. It was not possible to create Shoot clusters consisting of more than one worker node. Cluster auto-scaling therefore is not supported. It was not possible to create two or more Shoot clusters in parallel. The communication between the Seed and the Shoot Clusters uses VPN tunnel. In this setup tunnels are not needed since all components run on localhost.  Additional information To make sure that a specific Seed cluster will be chosen, specify the .spec.seedName field (see here for an example Shoot manifest).\nPlease take a look at the example manifests folder to see which resource objects you need to install into your Garden cluster.\nAppendix Configure Seed clusters for local development When using the Gardenlet in a local development scenario with make start-gardenlet then the Gardenlet component configuration is setup with a seed selector that targets all available Seed clusters. However, a Seed resource needs to be configured to allow being reconciled by a Gardenlet which such a configuration.\nWhen deploying the Gardenlet to reconcile only one Seed cluster (using component configuration .seedConfig), the Gardenlet either needs to be supplied with a kubeconfig for the particular Seed cluster, or acquires one via bootstrapping. Having said that, if the Gardenlet is configured to manage multiple Seed clusters based on a label selector, it needs to fetch the kubeconfig of each Seed cluster at runtime from somewhere. That is why the Seed resource needs to be configured with an additional secret reference that contains the kubeconfig of the Seed cluster.\nCreate a secret containing the base64 encoded kubeconfig of the Seed cluster (the scope of the permissions should be identical to the kubeconfig that the Gardenlet creates during bootstrapping - for now, cluster-admin privileges are recommended).\nCreate the secret in the Garden cluster:\napiVersion:v1kind:Secretmetadata:name:sweet-seednamespace:gardentype:Opaquedata:kubeconfig:\u0026lt;base64-seed-kubeconfig\u0026gt;.Adjust the Seed resource to reference the secret in spec.secretRef like so:\napiVersion:core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1kind:Seedmetadata:name:my-sweet-seedspec:...secretRef:name:sweet-seednamespace:garden"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/v1.13.2/contribute/10_code/13_env/","title":"Environment","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Preparing the Setup Conceptually, all Gardener components are designated to run inside as a Pod inside a Kubernetes cluster. The API server extends the Kubernetes API via the user-aggregated API server concepts. However, if you want to develop it, you may want to work locally with the Gardener without building a Docker image and deploying it to a cluster each and every time. That means that the Gardener runs outside a Kubernetes cluster which requires providing a Kubeconfig in your local filesystem and point the Gardener to it when starting it (see below).\nFurther details could be found in\n Principles of Kubernetes, and its components Kubernetes Development Guide Architecture of Gardener  This setup is based on minikube, a Kubernetes cluster running on a single node. Docker for Desktop and kind are also supported.\nInstalling Golang environment Install latest version of Golang. For MacOS you could use Homebrew:\nbrew install golang For other OS, please check Go installation documentation.\nInstalling kubectl and helm As already mentioned in the introduction, the communication with the Gardener happens via the Kubernetes (Garden) cluster it is targeting. To interact with that cluster, you need to install kubectl. Please make sure that the version of kubectl is at least v1.11.x.\nOn MacOS run\nbrew install kubernetes-cli Please check the kubectl installation documentation for other OS.\nYou may also need to develop Helm charts or interact with Tiller using the Helm CLI:\nOn MacOS run\nbrew install kubernetes-helm On other OS please check the Helm installation documentation.\nInstalling git We use git as VCS which you need to install.\nOn MacOS run\nbrew install git On other OS, please check the Git installation documentation.\nInstalling openvpn We use OpenVPN to establish network connectivity from the control plane running in the Seed cluster to the Shoot\u0026rsquo;s worker nodes running in private networks. To harden the security we need to generate another secret to encrypt the network traffic (details). Please install the openvpn binary. On MacOS run\nbrew install openvpn export PATH=$(brew --prefix openvpn)/sbin:$PATH On other OS, please check the OpenVPN downloads page.\nInstalling Minikube You\u0026rsquo;ll need to have minikube installed and running.\n Note: Gardener is working only with self-contained kubeconfig files because of security issue. You can configure your minikube to create self-contained kubeconfig files via:\nminikube config set embed-certs true  Alternatively, you can also install Docker for Desktop and kind.\nIn case you want to use the \u0026ldquo;Docker for Mac Kubernetes\u0026rdquo; or if you want to build Docker images for the Gardener you have to install Docker itself. On MacOS, please use Docker for MacOS which can be downloaded here.\nOn other OS, please check the Docker installation documentation.\nInstalling iproute2 iproute2 provides a collection of utilities for network administration and configuration.\nOn MacOS run\nbrew install iproute2mac Installing yaml2json and jq go get -u github.com/bronze1man/yaml2json brew install jq [MacOS only] Install GNU core utilities When running on MacOS you have to install the GNU core utilities:\nbrew install coreutils gnu-sed This will create symbolic links for the GNU utilities with g prefix in /usr/local/bin, e.g., gsed or gbase64. To allow using them without the g prefix please put /usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin at the beginning of your PATH environment variable, e.g., export PATH=/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH.\n[Windows] WSL2 Apart from Linux distributions and MacOS, the local gardener setup can also run on the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2.\nWhile WSL1, plain docker for windows and various Linux distributions and local Kubernetes environments may be supported, this setup was verified with:\n WSL2 Docker Desktop WSL2 Engine Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on WSL2 Nodeless local garden (see below)  The Gardener repository and all the above-mentioned tools (git, golang, kubectl, \u0026hellip;) should be installed in your WSL2 distro, according to the distribution-specific Linux installation instructions.\n[Optional] Installing gcloud SDK In case you have to create a new release or a new hotfix of the Gardener you have to push the resulting Docker image into a Docker registry. Currently, we are using the Google Container Registry (this could change in the future). Please follow the official installation instructions from Google.\nLocal Gardener setup This setup is only meant to be used for developing purposes, which means that only the control plane of the Gardener cluster is running on your machine.\nGet the sources Clone the repository from GitHub.\ngit clone git@github.com:gardener/gardener.git cd gardener Start the Gardener :warning: Before you start developing, please ensure to comply with the following requirements:\n You have understood the principles of Kubernetes, and its components, what their purpose is and how they interact with each other. You have understood the architecture of Gardener, and what the various clusters are used for.  Start a local kubernetes cluster For the development of Gardener you need some kind of Kubernetes cluster, which can be used as a \u0026ldquo;garden\u0026rdquo; cluster. I.e. you need a Kubernetes API server on which you can register a APIService Gardener\u0026rsquo;s own Extension API Server.\nFor this you can use a standard tool from the community to setup a local cluster like minikube, kind or the Kubernetes Cluster feature in Docker for Desktop.\nHowever, if you develop and run Gardener\u0026rsquo;s components locally, you don\u0026rsquo;t actually a fully fledged Kubernetes Cluster, i.e. you don\u0026rsquo;t actually need to run Pods on it. If you want to use a more lightweight approach for development purposes, you can use the \u0026ldquo;nodeless Garden cluster setup\u0026rdquo; residing in hack/local-garden. This is the easiest way to get your Gardener development setup up and running.\nUsing the nodeless cluster setup\nSetting up a local nodeless Garden cluster is quite simple. The only prerequisite is a running docker daemon. Just use the provided Makefile rules to start your local Garden:\nmake local-garden-up [...] Starting gardener-dev kube-etcd cluster..! Starting gardener-dev kube-apiserver..! Starting gardener-dev kube-controller-manager..! Starting gardener-dev gardener-etcd cluster..! namespace/garden created clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/gardener.cloud:admin created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/front-proxy-client created [...] This will start all minimally required components of a Kubernetes cluster (etcd, kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager) and an etcd Instance for the gardener-apiserver as Docker containers.\nTo tear down the local Garden cluster and remove the Docker containers, simply run:\nmake local-garden-down Using minikube\nAlternatively, spin up a cluster with minikube with this command:\nminikube start --embed-certs # `--embed-certs` can be omitted if minikube has already been set to create self-contained kubeconfig files. 😄 minikube v1.8.2 on Darwin 10.15.3 🔥 Creating virtualbox VM (CPUs=2, Memory=2048MB, Disk=20000MB) ...

In order to establish stable endpoints (robust against changes of the load balancer address), it creates DNS records pointing to these load balancer addresses. They are used internally and by all cluster components to communicate. You need to have control over a domain (or subdomain) for which these records will be created. Please provide an internal domain secret (see this for an example) which contains credentials with the proper privileges.

Also, please refer to this document for further information about how extensions are registered in case you want to use other versions than the latest releases.\nThe Gardener should now be ready to operate on Shoot resources. You can use\nkubectl get shoots No resources found. to operate against your local running Gardener API Server.\n Note: It may take several seconds until the minikube cluster recognizes that the Gardener API server has been started and is available. No resources found is the expected result of our initial development setup.\n Limitations of local development setup You can run Gardener (API server, controller manager, scheduler, gardenlet) against any local Kubernetes cluster, however, your seed and shoot clusters must be deployed to a \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; provider. Currently, it is not possible to run Gardener entirely isolated from any cloud provider. We are planning to support a setup that can run completely locally (see this for details), however, it does not yet exist. This means that - after you have setup Gardener - you need to register an external seed cluster (e.g., one created in AWS). Only after that step you can start creating shoot clusters with your locally running Gardener.\nSome time ago, we had a local setup based on VirtualBox/Vagrant. However, as we have progressed with the Extensibility epic we noticed that this implementation/setup does no longer fit into how we envision external providers to be.

Monitoring of custom workloads running in the cluster is out of scope.\nOverview Each Shoot cluster comes with its own monitoring stack. The following components are deployed into the seed and shoot:\n Seed  Prometheus Grafana blackbox-exporter kube-state-metrics (Seed metrics) kube-state-metrics (Shoot metrics) Alertmanager (Optional)   Shoot  node-exporter(s) kube-state-metrics blackbox-exporter    In each Seed cluster there is a Prometheus in the garden namespace responsible for collecting metrics from the Seed kubelets and cAdvisors. These metrics are provided to each Shoot Prometheus via federation.\nThe alerts for all Shoot clusters hosted on a Seed are routed to a central Alertmanger running in the garden namespace of the Seed. The purpose of this central alertmanager is to forward all important alerts to the operators of the Gardener setup.\nThe Alertmanager in the Shoot namespace on the Seed is only responsible for forwarding alerts from its Shoot cluster to a cluster owner/cluster alert receiver via email. The Alertmanager is optional and the conditions for a deployment are already described here.\nAdding New Monitoring Targets After exploring the metrics which your component provides or adding new metrics, you should be aware which metrics are required to write the needed alerts and dashboards.\nPrometheus prefers a pull based metrics collection approach and therefore the targets to observe need to be defined upfront. The targets are defined in charts/seed-monitoring/charts/prometheus/templates/config.yaml. New scrape jobs can be added in the section scrape_configs. Detailed information how to configure scrape jobs and how to use the kubernetes service discovery are available in the Prometheus documentation.\nThe job_name of a scrape job should be the name of the component e.g. kube-apiserver or vpn. The collection interval should be the default of 30s. You do not need to specify this in the configuration.\nPlease do not ingest all metrics which are provided by a component. Rather collect only those metrics which are needed to define the alerts and dashboards (i.e. whitelist). This can be achieved by adding the following metric_relabel_configs statement to your scrape jobs (replace exampleComponent with component name).\n- job_name:example-component...metric_relabel_configs:{{include\u0026#34;prometheus.keep-metrics.metric-relabel-config\u0026#34;.Values.allowedMetrics.exampleComponent|indent6}}The whitelist for the metrics of your job can be maintained in charts/seed-monitoring/charts/prometheus/values.yaml in section allowedMetrics.exampleComponent (replace exampleComponent with component name). Check the following example:\nallowedMetrics:...exampleComponent:*metrics_name_1*metrics_name_2...Adding Alerts The alert definitons are located in charts/seed-monitoring/charts/prometheus/rules. There are two approaches for adding new alerts.\n Adding additional alerts for a component which already has a set of alerts. In this case you have to extend the existing rule file for the component.

Monitoring of custom workloads running in the cluster is out of scope.\nOverview Each Shoot cluster comes with its own monitoring stack. The following components are deployed into the seed and shoot:\n Seed  Prometheus Grafana blackbox-exporter kube-state-metrics (Seed metrics) kube-state-metrics (Shoot metrics) Alertmanager (Optional)   Shoot  node-exporter(s) kube-state-metrics blackbox-exporter    In each Seed cluster there is a Prometheus in the garden namespace responsible for collecting metrics from the Seed kubelets and cAdvisors. These metrics are provided to each Shoot Prometheus via federation.\nThe alerts for all Shoot clusters hosted on a Seed are routed to a central Alertmanger running in the garden namespace of the Seed. The purpose of this central alertmanager is to forward all important alerts to the operators of the Gardener setup.\nThe Alertmanager in the Shoot namespace on the Seed is only responsible for forwarding alerts from its Shoot cluster to a cluster owner/cluster alert receiver via email. The Alertmanager is optional and the conditions for a deployment are already described here.\nAdding New Monitoring Targets After exploring the metrics which your component provides or adding new metrics, you should be aware which metrics are required to write the needed alerts and dashboards.\nPrometheus prefers a pull based metrics collection approach and therefore the targets to observe need to be defined upfront. The targets are defined in charts/seed-monitoring/charts/prometheus/templates/config.yaml. New scrape jobs can be added in the section scrape_configs. Detailed information how to configure scrape jobs and how to use the kubernetes service discovery are available in the Prometheus documentation.\nThe job_name of a scrape job should be the name of the component e.g. kube-apiserver or vpn. The collection interval should be the default of 30s. You do not need to specify this in the configuration.\nPlease do not ingest all metrics which are provided by a component. Rather collect only those metrics which are needed to define the alerts and dashboards (i.e. whitelist). This can be achieved by adding the following metric_relabel_configs statement to your scrape jobs (replace exampleComponent with component name).\n- job_name:example-component...metric_relabel_configs:{{include\u0026#34;prometheus.keep-metrics.metric-relabel-config\u0026#34;.Values.allowedMetrics.exampleComponent|indent6}}The whitelist for the metrics of your job can be maintained in charts/seed-monitoring/charts/prometheus/values.yaml in section allowedMetrics.exampleComponent (replace exampleComponent with component name).

There are two approaches for adding new alerts.\n Adding additional alerts for a component which already has a set of alerts. In this case you have to extend the existing rule file for the component. Adding alerts for a new component. In this case a new rule file with name scheme example-component.rules.yaml needs to be added.

The assignment of the component dashboards to the categories should be handled via dashboard tags.\n Kubernetes control plane components (Tag: control-plane)  All components which are part of the Kubernetes control plane e. g. Kube API Server, Kube Controller Manager, Kube Scheduler and Cloud Controller Manager ETCD + Backup/Restore Kubernetes Addon Manager   Node/Machine components (Tag: node/machine)  All metrics which are related to the behaviour/control of the Kubernetes nodes and kubelets Machine-Controller-Manager + Cluster Autoscaler   Networking components (Tag: network)  CoreDNS, KubeProxy, Calico, VPN, Nginx Ingress   Addon components (Tag: addon)  Cert Broker   Monitoring components (Tag: monitoring) Logging components (Tag: logging)  Mandatory Charts for Component Dashboards For each new component, its corresponding dashboard should contain the following charts in the first row, before adding custom charts for the component in the subsequent rows.\n Pod up/down status up{job=\u0026quot;example-component\u0026quot;} Pod/containers cpu utilization Pod/containers memorty consumption Pod/containers network i/o  These information is provided by the cAdvisor metrics. These metrics are already integrated. Please check the other dashboards for detailed information on how to query.\nChart Requirements Each chart needs to contain:\n a meaningful name a detailed description (for non trivial charts) appropriate x/y axis descriptions appropriate scaling levels for the x/y axis proper units for the x/y axis  Dashboard Parameters The following parameters should be added to all dashboards to ensure a homogeneous experience across all dashboards.\nDashboards have to \u0026hellip;\n contain a title which refers to the component name(s) contain a timezone statement which should be the browser time contain tags which express where the component is running (seed or shoot) and to which category the component belong (see dashboard structure) contain a version statement with a value of 1 be immutable  Example dashboard configuration\n{ \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;example-component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;timezone\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;browser\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;seed\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;control-plane\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;editable\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;false\u0026#34; } Furthermore all dashboards should contain the following time options:\n{ \u0026#34;time\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;from\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;now-1h\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;to\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;now\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;timepicker\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;refresh_intervals\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;30s\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;1m\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;5m\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;time_options\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;5m\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;15m\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;1h\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;6h\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;12h\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;24h\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;2d\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;10d\u0026#34; ] } } "},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/documentation/concepts/extensions/overview/","title":"Extensibility overview","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Extensibility overview Initially, everything was developed in-tree in the Gardener project.

It facilitates the administration of one or many garden, seed and shoot clusters, e.g. to check for issues which occured in one of these clusters. Details about the concept behind the Gardener are described in the Gardener wiki.\nInstallation gardenctl is shipped for mac and linux in a binary format.\nOption 1: Install the latest release with Homebrew (macOS and Linux) as follows:\nbrew install gardener/tap/gardenctl Option 2: Manually download and install from gardenctl releases as follows:\n Download the latest release:  curl -LO https://github.com/gardener/gardenctl/releases/download/$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gardener/gardenctl/master/LATEST)/gardenctl-darwin-amd64 To download a specific version, replace the $(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gardener/gardenctl/master/LATEST) portion of the command with the specific version.\nFor example, to download version 0.16.0 on macOS, type:\ncurl -LO https://github.com/gardener/gardenctl/releases/download/v0.16.0/gardenctl-darwin-amd64 Make the gardenctl binary executable.  chmod +x ./gardenctl-darwin-amd64 Move the binary in to your PATH.  sudo mv ./gardenctl-darwin-amd64 /usr/local/bin/gardenctl How to build it If no binary builds are available for your platform or architecture, you can build it from source, go get it or build the docker image from Dockerfile. Please keep in mind to use an up to date version of golang.\nPrerequisites To build gardenctl from sources you need to have a running Golang environment. Moreover, since gardenctl allows to execute kubectl as well as a running kubectl installation is recommended, but not required. Please check this description for further details.\nBuild gardenctl From source First, you need to clone the repository and build gardenctl.\ngit clone https://github.com/gardener/gardenctl.git cd gardenctl make build After successfully building gardenctl the executables are in the directory ~/go/src/github.com/gardener/gardenctl/bin/. Next, move the executable for your architecture to /usr/local/bin. In this case for darwin-amd64.\nsudo mv bin/darwin-amd64/gardenctl-darwin-amd64 /usr/local/bin/gardenctl gardenctl supports auto completion. This recommended feature is bound to gardenctl or the alias g. To configure it you can run:\nif you are using bash:\necho \u0026#34;source \u0026lt;(gardenctl completion bash)\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.bashrc source ~/.bashrc if you are using zsh:\necho \u0026#34;source \u0026lt;(gardenctl completion zsh)\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.zshrc source ~/.zshrc Via Dockerfile First clone the repository as described in the the build step \u0026ldquo;From source\u0026rdquo;.

This API differs from SIG Cluster Lifecycle\u0026rsquo;s Cluster API that only harmonizes how to get to clusters, while Gardener\u0026rsquo;s Cluster API goes one step further and also harmonizes the make-up of the clusters themselves. That means, Gardener gives you homogeneous clusters with exactly the same bill of material, configuration and behavior on all supported infrastructures, which you can see further down below in the section on our K8s Conformance Test Coverage.\nIn 2020, SIG Cluster Lifecycle\u0026rsquo;s Cluster API made a huge step forward with v1alpha3 and the newly added support for declarative control plane management. This made it possible to integrate managed services like GKE or Gardener. We would be more than happy, if the community would be interested, to contribute a Gardener control plane provider. For more information on the relation between Gardener API and SIG Cluster Lifecycle\u0026rsquo;s Cluster API, please see here.\nGardener\u0026rsquo;s main principle is to leverage Kubernetes concepts for all of its tasks.\nIn essence, Gardener is an extension API server that comes along with a bundle of custom controllers. It introduces new API objects in an existing Kubernetes cluster (which is called garden cluster) in order to use them for the management of end-user Kubernetes clusters (which are called shoot clusters). These shoot clusters are described via declarative cluster specifications which are observed by the controllers. They will bring up the clusters, reconcile their state, perform automated updates and make sure they are always up and running.\nTo accomplish these tasks reliably and to offer a high quality of service, Gardener controls the main components of a Kubernetes cluster (etcd, API server, controller manager, scheduler). These so-called control plane components are hosted in Kubernetes clusters themselves (which are called seed clusters). This is the main difference compared to many other OSS cluster provisioning tools: The shoot clusters do not have dedicated master VMs. Instead, the control plane is deployed as a native Kubernetes workload into the seeds (the architecture is commonly referred to as kubeception or inception design). This does not only effectively reduce the total cost of ownership but also allows easier implementations for \u0026ldquo;day-2 operations\u0026rdquo; (like cluster updates or robustness) by relying on all the mature Kubernetes features and capabilities.\nGardener reuses the identical Kubernetes design to span a scalable multi-cloud and multi-cluster landscape. Such familiarity with known concepts has proven to quickly ease the initial learning curve and accelerate developer productivity:\n Kubernetes API Server = Gardener API Server Kubernetes Controller Manager = Gardener Controller Manager Kubernetes Scheduler = Gardener Scheduler Kubelet = Gardenlet Node = Seed cluster Pod = Shoot cluster  Please find more information regarding the concepts and a detailed description of the architecture in our Gardener Wiki and our blog posts on kubernetes.io: Gardener - the Kubernetes Botanist (17.5.2018) and Gardener Project Update (2.12.2019).\n K8s Conformance Test Coverage Conformance test results of latest stable Gardener release, transparently visible at the CNCF test grid:\n   Provider/K8s v1.20 v1.19 v1.18 v1.17 v1.16 v1.15 v1.14 v1.13 v1.12 v1.11 v1.10     AWS N/A     [2] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1]   Azure N/A     [2] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1]   GCP N/A     [2] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1]   OpenStack N/A     [2] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1]   Alicloud N/A     [2] N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A   Packet N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A   vSphere N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A    [1] Version is technically supported but no longer actively tested.

Note down the name of your secret. I chose the GCP infrastructure from the vast possible options that my Gardener provides me with, so i had named the secret as shoot-operator-gcp.\nFrom the Access widget (leave the default settings) download your personalized kubeconfig into ~/.kube/kubeconfig-garden-myproject. Follow the instructions to setup kubelogin: For convinience, let us set an alias command with\nalias kgarden=\u0026#34;kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.kube/kubeconfig-garden-myproject.yaml\u0026#34; kgarden now gives you all botanical powers and connects you directly with your Gardener.\nYou should now be able to run kgarden get shoots, automatically get an oidc token, and list already running clusters/shoots.\nPrepare your Custom Domain I am going to use Cloud Flare as programmatic DNS of my custom domain mydomain.io. Please follow detailed instructions from Cloud Flare on how to delegate your domain (the free account does not support delegating subdomains). Alternatively, AWS Route53 (and most others) support delegating subdomains.\nI needed to follow these instructions and created the following secret:\napiVersion:v1kind:Secretmetadata:name:cloudflare-mydomain-iotype:Opaquedata:CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN:useYOURownDAMITzNDU2Nzg5MDEyMzQ1Njc4OQ==Apply this secret into your project with kgarden create -f cloudflare-mydomain-io.yaml.\nOur External DNS Manager also supports Amazon Route53, Google CloudDNS, AliCloud DNS, Azure DNS, or OpenStack Designate. Check it out.\nPrepare Gardener Extensions I now need to prepare the Gardener extensions shoot-dns-service and shoot-cert-service and set the parameters accordingly.\nPlease note, that the availability of Gardener Extensions depends on how your administrator has configured the Gardener landscape. Please contact your Gardener administrator in case you experience any issues during activation.\n The following snipplet allows Gardener to manage my entire custom domain, whereas with the include: attribute I restrict all dynamic entries under the subdomain gsicdc.mydomain.io:\ndns:providers:- domains:include:- gsicdc.mydomain.ioprimary:falsesecretName:cloudflare-mydomain-iotype:cloudflare-dnsextensions:- type:shoot-dns-serviceThe next snipplet allows Gardener to manage certificates automatically from Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt on mydomain.io for me:\nextensions:- type:shoot-cert-serviceproviderConfig:apiVersion:service.cert.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1issuers:- email:me@mail.comname:mydomainserver:\u0026#39;https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory\u0026#39;- email:me@mail.comname:mydomain-stagingserver:\u0026#39;https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory\u0026#39;Adjust the snipplets with your parameters (don't forget your email).

My provider Cloud Flare is very very quick (as opposed to some other services). You should be able to verify the entry with dig lovemygardener.gsicdc.mydomain.io within seconds. The Certificate Mangement picks up the request as well and initates a DNS01 protocol exchange with Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt; using the staging environment referred to with the issuer behind mydomain-staging. After aproximately 70sec (give and take) you will receive the wildcard certificate in the wildcard-tls secret in the namespace istio-system.  Notice, that the namespace for the certificate secret is often the cause of many troubeshooting sessions: the secret must reside in the same namespace of the gateway.\n Here is the istio-install script:\n$ export domainname=\u0026#34;*.gsicdc.mydomain.io\u0026#34; $ export issuer=\u0026#34;mydomain-staging\u0026#34; $ cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF | istioctl install -y -f - apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1 kind: IstioOperator spec: profile: default components: ingressGateways: - name: istio-ingressgateway enabled: true k8s: serviceAnnotations: cert.gardener.cloud/issuer: \u0026#34;${issuer}\u0026#34; cert.gardener.cloud/secretname: wildcard-tls dns.gardener.cloud/class: garden dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames: \u0026#34;${domainname}\u0026#34; dns.gardener.cloud/ttl: \u0026#34;120\u0026#34; EOF Verify that setup is working and that DNS and certificates have been created/delivered:\n$ kubectl -n istio-system describe service istio-ingressgateway \u0026lt;snip\u0026gt; Events: Type Reason Age From Message ---- ------ ---- ---- ------- Normal EnsuringLoadBalancer 58s service-controller Ensuring load balancer Normal reconcile 58s cert-controller-manager created certificate object istio-system/istio-ingressgateway-service-pwqdm Normal cert-annotation 58s cert-controller-manager wildcard-tls: cert request is pending Normal cert-annotation 54s cert-controller-manager wildcard-tls: certificate pending: certificate requested, preparing/waiting for successful DNS01 challenge Normal cert-annotation 28s cert-controller-manager wildcard-tls: certificate ready Normal EnsuredLoadBalancer 26s service-controller Ensured load balancer Normal reconcile 26s dns-controller-manager created dns entry object shoot--core--gsicdc/istio-ingressgateway-service-p9qqb Normal dns-annotation 26s dns-controller-manager *.gsicdc.mydomain.io: dns entry is pending Normal dns-annotation 21s (x3 over 21s) dns-controller-manager *.gsicdc.mydomain.io: dns entry active $ dig lovemygardener.gsicdc.mydomain.io ; \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; DiG 9.10.6 \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; lovemygardener.gsicdc.mydomain.io \u0026lt;snip\u0026gt; ;; ANSWER SECTION: lovemygardener.gsicdc.mydomain.io. 120 IN A\t35.195.120.62 \u0026lt;snip\u0026gt; There you have it, the wildcard-tls certificate is ready and the *.gsicdc.mydomain.io dns entry is active.

You should learn about Kubernetes networking, and first try to debug problems yourself. With a solid managed cluster from Gardener, it is always PEBCAK!\n Kubernetes Ingress is a subject that is evolving to much broader standard. Please watch Evolving the Kubernetes Ingress APIs to GA and Beyond for a good introduction. In this example, I did not want to use the Kubernetes Ingress compatibility option of Istio.

Notice, that the namespace for the certificate secret is often the cause of many troubeshooting sessions: the secret must reside in the same namespace of the gateway.\n Here is the istio-install script:\n$ export domainname=\u0026#34;*.gsicdc.mydomain.io\u0026#34; $ export issuer=\u0026#34;mydomain-staging\u0026#34; $ cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF | istioctl install -y -f - apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1 kind: IstioOperator spec: profile: default components: ingressGateways: - name: istio-ingressgateway enabled: true k8s: serviceAnnotations: cert.gardener.cloud/issuer: \u0026#34;${issuer}\u0026#34; cert.gardener.cloud/secretname: wildcard-tls dns.gardener.cloud/class: garden dns.gardener.cloud/dnsnames: \u0026#34;${domainname}\u0026#34; dns.gardener.cloud/ttl: \u0026#34;120\u0026#34; EOF Verify that setup is working and that DNS and certificates have been created/delivered:\n$ kubectl -n istio-system describe service istio-ingressgateway \u0026lt;snip\u0026gt; Events: Type Reason Age From Message ---- ------ ---- ---- ------- Normal EnsuringLoadBalancer 58s service-controller Ensuring load balancer Normal reconcile 58s cert-controller-manager created certificate object istio-system/istio-ingressgateway-service-pwqdm Normal cert-annotation 58s cert-controller-manager wildcard-tls: cert request is pending Normal cert-annotation 54s cert-controller-manager wildcard-tls: certificate pending: certificate requested, preparing/waiting for successful DNS01 challenge Normal cert-annotation 28s cert-controller-manager wildcard-tls: certificate ready Normal EnsuredLoadBalancer 26s service-controller Ensured load balancer Normal reconcile 26s dns-controller-manager created dns entry object shoot--core--gsicdc/istio-ingressgateway-service-p9qqb Normal dns-annotation 26s dns-controller-manager *.gsicdc.mydomain.io: dns entry is pending Normal dns-annotation 21s (x3 over 21s) dns-controller-manager *.gsicdc.mydomain.io: dns entry active $ dig lovemygardener.gsicdc.mydomain.io ; \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; DiG 9.10.6 \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; lovemygardener.gsicdc.mydomain.io \u0026lt;snip\u0026gt; ;; ANSWER SECTION: lovemygardener.gsicdc.mydomain.io. 120 IN A\t35.195.120.62 \u0026lt;snip\u0026gt; There you have it, the wildcard-tls certificate is ready and the *.gsicdc.mydomain.io dns entry is active.

You should learn about Kubernetes networking, and first try to debug problems yourself. With a solid managed cluster from Gardener, it is always PEBCAK!\n Kubernetes Ingress is a subject that is evolving to much broader standard. Please watch Evolving the Kubernetes Ingress APIs to GA and Beyond for a good introduction. In this example, I did not want to use the Kubernetes Ingress compatibility option of Istio.

This can be required if a node misbehaves or fails to join the cluster in the first place.\nWith access to the host, it is for instance possible to check the kubelet logs and interact with common tools such as systemctland journalctl.\nThe first section of this guide explores options to get a shell to the node of a Gardener Kubernetes cluster. The options described in the second section do not rely on Kubernetes capabilities to get shell access to a node and thus can also be used if an instance failed to join the cluster.\nThis guide only covers how to get access to the host, but does not cover troubleshooting methods.\n Get a Shell to a Kubernetes Node Get a Shell to an operational cluster node  Gardener Dashboard gardenctl shell Gardener Ops Toolbelt Custom root pod   SSH access to a node that failed to join the cluster  Identifying the problematic instance gardenctl ssh SSH with manually created Bastion on AWS  Create the Bastion Security Group Create the bastion instance   Connecting to the target instance Cleanup    Get a Shell to an operational cluster node The following describes four different approaches to get a shell to an operational Shoot worker node. As a prerequisite to troubleshooting a Kubernetes node, the node must have joined the cluster successfully and be able to run a pod. All of the described approaches involve scheduling a pod with root permissions and mounting the root filesystem.\nGardener Dashboard Prerequisite: the terminal feature is configured for the Gardener dashboard.\nNavigate to the cluster overview page and find the Terminal in the Access tile.\nSelect the target Cluster (Garden, Seed / Control Plane, Shoot cluster) depending on the requirements and access rights (only certain users have access to the Seed Control Plane).\nTo open the terminal configuration, click on the top right-hand corner of the screen.\nSet the Terminal Runtime to \u0026ldquo;Privileged. Also specify the target node from the drop-down menu.\nThe dashboard then schedules a pod and opens a shell session to the node.\nTo get access to common binaries installed on the host, prefix the command with chroot /hostroot. Note that the path depends on where the root path is mounted in the container. In the default image used by the Dashboard, it is under /hostroot.\ngardenctl shell Prerequisite: kubectl and gardenctl are available and configured.\nFirst, target a Garden cluster containing all the Shoot definitions.\n$ gardenctl target garden \u0026lt;target-garden\u0026gt; Target an available Shoot by name. This sets up the context and configures the kubeconfig file of the Shoot cluster. Subsequent commands will execute in this context.\n$ gardenctl target shoot \u0026lt;target-shoot\u0026gt; Get the nodes of the Shoot cluster.\n$ gardenctl kubectl get nodes Pick a node name from the list above and get a root shell access to it.\n$ gardenctl shell \u0026lt;target-node\u0026gt; Gardener Ops Toolbelt Prerequisite: kubectl is available.\nThe Gardener ops-toolbelt can be used as a convenient way to deploy a root pod to a node. The pod uses an image that is bundled with a bunch of useful troubleshooting tools. This is also the same image that is used by default when using the Gardener Dashboard terminal feature as described in the previous section.\nThe easiest way to use the Gardener ops-toolbelt is to execute the ops-pod script in the hacks folder. To get root shell access to a node, execute the aforementioned script by supplying the target node name as an argument:\n$ \u0026lt;path-to-ops-toolbelt-repo\u0026gt;/hacks/ops-pod \u0026lt;target-node\u0026gt; Custom root pod Alternatively, a pod can be assigned to a target node and a shell can be opened via standard Kubernetes means. To enable root access to the node, the pod specification requires proper securityContext and volume properties.\nFor instance you can use the following pod manifest, after changing  with the name of the node you want this pod attached to:\napiVersion:v1kind:Podmetadata:name:privileged-podnamespace:defaultspec:nodeSelector:kubernetes.io/hostname:\u0026lt;target-node-name\u0026gt; containers:- name:busyboximage:busyboxstdin:truesecurityContext:privileged:truevolumeMounts:- name:host-root-volumemountPath:/hostreadOnly:truevolumes:- name:host-root-volumehostPath:path:/hostNetwork:truehostPID:truerestartPolicy:NeverSSH access to a node that failed to join the cluster This section explores two options that can be used to get SSH access to a node that failed to join the cluster. As it is not possible to schedule a pod on the node, the Kubernetes-based methods explored so far cannot be used in this scenario.\nAdditionally, Gardener typically provisions worker instances in a private subnet of the VPC, hence - there is no public IP address that could be used for direct SSH access.\nFor this scenario, cloud providers typically have extensive documentation (e.g AWS \u0026amp; GCP and in some cases tooling support). However, these approaches are mostly cloud provider specific, require interaction via their CLI and API or sometimes the installation of a cloud provider specific agent one the node.\nAlternatively, gardenctl can be used providing a cloud provider agnostic and out-of-the-box support to get ssh access to an instance in a private subnet. Currently gardenctl supports AWS, GCP, Openstack, Azure and Alibaba Cloud.\nIdentifying the problematic instance First, the problematic instance has to be identified. In Gardener, worker pools can be created in different cloud provider regions, zones and accounts.\nThe instance would typically show up as successfully started / running in the cloud provider dashboard or API and it is not immediately obvious which one has a problem. Instead, we can use the Gardener API / CRDs to obtain the faulty instance identifier in a cloud-agnostic way.\nGardener uses the Machine Controller Manager to create the Shoot worker nodes. For each worker node, the Machine Controller Manager creates a Machine CRD in the Shoot namespace in the respective Seed cluster. Usually the problematic instance can be identified as the respective Machine CRD has status pending.\nThe instance / node name can be obtained from the Machine .status field:\n$ kubectl get machine \u0026lt;machine-name\u0026gt; -o json | jq -r .status.node This is all the information needed to go ahead and use gardenctl ssh to get a shell to the node. In addition, the used cloud provider, the specific identifier of the instance and the instance region can be identified from the Machine CRD.\nGet the identifier of the instance via:\n$ kubectl get machine \u0026lt;machine-name\u0026gt; -o json | jq -r .spec.providerID // e.g aws:///eu-north-1/i-069733c435bdb4640 The identifier shows that the instance belongs to the cloud provider aws with the ec2 instance-id i-069733c435bdb4640 in region eu-north-1.\nTo get more information about the instance, check out the MachineClass (e.g AWSMachineClass) that is associated with each Machine CRD in the Shoot namespace of the Seed cluster. The AWSMachineClass contains the machine image (ami), machine-type, iam information, network-interfaces, subnets, security groups and attached volumes.\nOf course, the information can also be used to get the instance with the cloud provider CLI / API.\ngardenctl ssh Using the node name of the problematic instance, we can use the gardenctl ssh command to get SSH access to the cloud provider instance via an automatically set up bastion host. gardenctl takes care of spinning up the bastion instance, setting up the SSH keys, ports and security groups and opens a root shell on the target instance. After the SSH session has ended, gardenctl deletes the created cloud provider resources.\nUse the following commands:\nFirst, target a Garden cluster containing all the Shoot definitions.\n$ gardenctl target garden \u0026lt;target-garden\u0026gt; Target an available Shoot by name. This sets up the context, configures the kubeconfig file of the Shoot cluster and downloads the cloud provider credentials. Subsequent commands will execute in this context.\n$ gardenctl target shoot \u0026lt;target-shoot\u0026gt; This uses the cloud provider credentials to spin up the bastion and to open a shell on the target instance.\n$ gardenctl ssh \u0026lt;target-node\u0026gt; SSH with manually created Bastion on AWS In case you are not using gardenctl or want to control the bastion instance yourself, you can also manually set it up. The steps described here are generally the same as those used by gardenctl internally. Despite some cloud provider specifics they can be generalized to the following list:\n Open port 22 on the target instance. Create an instance / VM in a public subnet (bastion instance needs to have public ip address). Set-up security groups, roles and open port 22 for the bastion instance.  The following diagram shows an overview how the SSH access to the target instance works:\nThis guide demonstrates the setup of a bastion on AWS.\nPrerequisites:\n The AWS CLI is set up. Obtain target instance-id (see here). Obtain the VPC ID the Shoot resources are created in. This can be found in the Infrastructure CRD in the Shoot namespace in the Seed. Make sure that port 22 on the target instance is open (default for Gardener deployed instances).  Extract security group via  $ aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids \u0026lt;instance-id\u0026gt;  Check for rule that allows inbound connections on port 22:  $ aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids=\u0026lt;security-group-id\u0026gt;  If not available, create the rule with the following comamnd:  $ aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id \u0026lt;security-group-id\u0026gt; --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0   Create the Bastion Security Group   The common name of the security group is \u0026lt;shoot-name\u0026gt;-bsg. Create the security group:\n$ aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name \u0026lt;bastion-security-group-name\u0026gt; --description ssh-access --vpc-id \u0026lt;VPC-ID\u0026gt;   Optionally, create identifying tags for the security group:\n$ aws ec2 create-tags --resources \u0026lt;bastion-security-group-id\u0026gt; --tags Key=component,Value=\u0026lt;tag\u0026gt;   Create permission in the bastion security group that allows ssh access on port 22.\n$ aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id \u0026lt;bastion-security-group-id\u0026gt; --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0   Create an IAM role for the bastion instance with the name \u0026lt;shoot-name\u0026gt;-bastions:\n$ aws iam create-role --role-name \u0026lt;shoot-name\u0026gt;-bastions The content should be:\n  { \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;ec2:DescribeRegions\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; ] } ] }   Create the instance profile with name \u0026lt;shoot-name\u0026gt;-bastions:\n$ aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;   Add the created role to the instance profile:\n$ aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile --instance-profile-name \u0026lt;instance-profile-name\u0026gt; --role-name \u0026lt;role-name\u0026gt;   Create the bastion instance Next, in order to be able to ssh into the bastion instance, the instance has to be set up with a user with a public ssh key. Create a user gardener that has the same Gardener-generated public ssh key as the target instance.\n  First, we need to get the public part of the Shoot ssh-key.

This can be required if a node misbehaves or fails to join the cluster in the first place.\nWith access to the host, it is for instance possible to check the kubelet logs and interact with common tools such as systemctland journalctl.\nThe first section of this guide explores options to get a shell to the node of a Gardener Kubernetes cluster. The options described in the second section do not rely on Kubernetes capabilities to get shell access to a node and thus can also be used if an instance failed to join the cluster.\nThis guide only covers how to get access to the host, but does not cover troubleshooting methods.\n Get a Shell to a Kubernetes Node Get a Shell to an operational cluster node  Gardener Dashboard gardenctl shell Gardener Ops Toolbelt Custom root pod   SSH access to a node that failed to join the cluster  Identifying the problematic instance gardenctl ssh SSH with manually created Bastion on AWS  Create the Bastion Security Group Create the bastion instance   Connecting to the target instance Cleanup    Get a Shell to an operational cluster node The following describes four different approaches to get a shell to an operational Shoot worker node. As a prerequisite to troubleshooting a Kubernetes node, the node must have joined the cluster successfully and be able to run a pod. All of the described approaches involve scheduling a pod with root permissions and mounting the root filesystem.\nGardener Dashboard Prerequisite: the terminal feature is configured for the Gardener dashboard.\nNavigate to the cluster overview page and find the Terminal in the Access tile.\nSelect the target Cluster (Garden, Seed / Control Plane, Shoot cluster) depending on the requirements and access rights (only certain users have access to the Seed Control Plane).\nTo open the terminal configuration, click on the top right-hand corner of the screen.\nSet the Terminal Runtime to \u0026ldquo;Privileged. Also specify the target node from the drop-down menu.\nThe dashboard then schedules a pod and opens a shell session to the node.\nTo get access to common binaries installed on the host, prefix the command with chroot /hostroot. Note that the path depends on where the root path is mounted in the container. In the default image used by the Dashboard, it is under /hostroot.\ngardenctl shell Prerequisite: kubectl and gardenctl are available and configured.\nFirst, target a Garden cluster containing all the Shoot definitions.\n$ gardenctl target garden \u0026lt;target-garden\u0026gt; Target an available Shoot by name. This sets up the context and configures the kubeconfig file of the Shoot cluster. Subsequent commands will execute in this context.\n$ gardenctl target shoot \u0026lt;target-shoot\u0026gt; Get the nodes of the Shoot cluster.\n$ gardenctl kubectl get nodes Pick a node name from the list above and get a root shell access to it.\n$ gardenctl shell \u0026lt;target-node\u0026gt; Gardener Ops Toolbelt Prerequisite: kubectl is available.\nThe Gardener ops-toolbelt can be used as a convenient way to deploy a root pod to a node. The pod uses an image that is bundled with a bunch of useful troubleshooting tools. This is also the same image that is used by default when using the Gardener Dashboard terminal feature as described in the previous section.\nThe easiest way to use the Gardener ops-toolbelt is to execute the ops-pod script in the hacks folder. To get root shell access to a node, execute the aforementioned script by supplying the target node name as an argument:\n$ \u0026lt;path-to-ops-toolbelt-repo\u0026gt;/hacks/ops-pod \u0026lt;target-node\u0026gt; Custom root pod Alternatively, a pod can be assigned to a target node and a shell can be opened via standard Kubernetes means. To enable root access to the node, the pod specification requires proper securityContext and volume properties.\nFor instance you can use the following pod manifest, after changing  with the name of the node you want this pod attached to:\napiVersion:v1kind:Podmetadata:name:privileged-podnamespace:defaultspec:nodeSelector:kubernetes.io/hostname:\u0026lt;target-node-name\u0026gt; containers:- name:busyboximage:busyboxstdin:truesecurityContext:privileged:truevolumeMounts:- name:host-root-volumemountPath:/hostreadOnly:truevolumes:- name:host-root-volumehostPath:path:/hostNetwork:truehostPID:truerestartPolicy:NeverSSH access to a node that failed to join the cluster This section explores two options that can be used to get SSH access to a node that failed to join the cluster. As it is not possible to schedule a pod on the node, the Kubernetes-based methods explored so far cannot be used in this scenario.\nAdditionally, Gardener typically provisions worker instances in a private subnet of the VPC, hence - there is no public IP address that could be used for direct SSH access.\nFor this scenario, cloud providers typically have extensive documentation (e.g AWS \u0026amp; GCP and in some cases tooling support). However, these approaches are mostly cloud provider specific, require interaction via their CLI and API or sometimes the installation of a cloud provider specific agent one the node.\nAlternatively, gardenctl can be used providing a cloud provider agnostic and out-of-the-box support to get ssh access to an instance in a private subnet. Currently gardenctl supports AWS, GCP, Openstack, Azure and Alibaba Cloud.\nIdentifying the problematic instance First, the problematic instance has to be identified. In Gardener, worker pools can be created in different cloud provider regions, zones and accounts.\nThe instance would typically show up as successfully started / running in the cloud provider dashboard or API and it is not immediately obvious which one has a problem. Instead, we can use the Gardener API / CRDs to obtain the faulty instance identifier in a cloud-agnostic way.\nGardener uses the Machine Controller Manager to create the Shoot worker nodes. For each worker node, the Machine Controller Manager creates a Machine CRD in the Shoot namespace in the respective Seed cluster. Usually the problematic instance can be identified as the respective Machine CRD has status pending.\nThe instance / node name can be obtained from the Machine .status field:\n$ kubectl get machine \u0026lt;machine-name\u0026gt; -o json | jq -r .status.node This is all the information needed to go ahead and use gardenctl ssh to get a shell to the node. In addition, the used cloud provider, the specific identifier of the instance and the instance region can be identified from the Machine CRD.\nGet the identifier of the instance via:\n$ kubectl get machine \u0026lt;machine-name\u0026gt; -o json | jq -r .spec.providerID // e.g aws:///eu-north-1/i-069733c435bdb4640 The identifier shows that the instance belongs to the cloud provider aws with the ec2 instance-id i-069733c435bdb4640 in region eu-north-1.\nTo get more information about the instance, check out the MachineClass (e.g AWSMachineClass) that is associated with each Machine CRD in the Shoot namespace of the Seed cluster. The AWSMachineClass contains the machine image (ami), machine-type, iam information, network-interfaces, subnets, security groups and attached volumes.\nOf course, the information can also be used to get the instance with the cloud provider CLI / API.\ngardenctl ssh Using the node name of the problematic instance, we can use the gardenctl ssh command to get SSH access to the cloud provider instance via an automatically set up bastion host. gardenctl takes care of spinning up the bastion instance, setting up the SSH keys, ports and security groups and opens a root shell on the target instance. After the SSH session has ended, gardenctl deletes the created cloud provider resources.\nUse the following commands:\nFirst, target a Garden cluster containing all the Shoot definitions.\n$ gardenctl target garden \u0026lt;target-garden\u0026gt; Target an available Shoot by name. This sets up the context, configures the kubeconfig file of the Shoot cluster and downloads the cloud provider credentials. Subsequent commands will execute in this context.\n$ gardenctl target shoot \u0026lt;target-shoot\u0026gt; This uses the cloud provider credentials to spin up the bastion and to open a shell on the target instance.\n$ gardenctl ssh \u0026lt;target-node\u0026gt; SSH with manually created Bastion on AWS In case you are not using gardenctl or want to control the bastion instance yourself, you can also manually set it up. The steps described here are generally the same as those used by gardenctl internally. Despite some cloud provider specifics they can be generalized to the following list:\n Open port 22 on the target instance. Create an instance / VM in a public subnet (bastion instance needs to have public ip address). Set-up security groups, roles and open port 22 for the bastion instance.  The following diagram shows an overview how the SSH access to the target instance works:\nThis guide demonstrates the setup of a bastion on AWS.\nPrerequisites:\n The AWS CLI is set up. Obtain target instance-id (see here). Obtain the VPC ID the Shoot resources are created in. This can be found in the Infrastructure CRD in the Shoot namespace in the Seed. Make sure that port 22 on the target instance is open (default for Gardener deployed instances).  Extract security group via  $ aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids \u0026lt;instance-id\u0026gt;  Check for rule that allows inbound connections on port 22:  $ aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids=\u0026lt;security-group-id\u0026gt;  If not available, create the rule with the following comamnd:  $ aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id \u0026lt;security-group-id\u0026gt; --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0   Create the Bastion Security Group   The common name of the security group is \u0026lt;shoot-name\u0026gt;-bsg. Create the security group:\n$ aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name \u0026lt;bastion-security-group-name\u0026gt; --description ssh-access --vpc-id \u0026lt;VPC-ID\u0026gt;   Optionally, create identifying tags for the security group:\n$ aws ec2 create-tags --resources \u0026lt;bastion-security-group-id\u0026gt; --tags Key=component,Value=\u0026lt;tag\u0026gt;   Create permission in the bastion security group that allows ssh access on port 22.\n$ aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id \u0026lt;bastion-security-group-id\u0026gt; --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0   Create an IAM role for the bastion instance with the name \u0026lt;shoot-name\u0026gt;-bastions:\n$ aws iam create-role --role-name \u0026lt;shoot-name\u0026gt;-bastions The content should be:\n  { \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;ec2:DescribeRegions\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; ] } ] }   Create the instance profile with name \u0026lt;shoot-name\u0026gt;-bastions:\n$ aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;   Add the created role to the instance profile:\n$ aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile --instance-profile-name \u0026lt;instance-profile-name\u0026gt; --role-name \u0026lt;role-name\u0026gt;   Create the bastion instance Next, in order to be able to ssh into the bastion instance, the instance has to be set up with a user with a public ssh key. Create a user gardener that has the same Gardener-generated public ssh key as the target instance.\n  First, we need to get the public part of the Shoot ssh-key. The ssh-key is stored in a secret in the the project namespace in the Garden cluster. The name is: \u0026lt;shoot-name\u0026gt;-ssh-publickey. Get the key via:\n$ kubectl get secret aws-gvisor.ssh-keypair -o json | jq -r .data.\\\u0026#34;id_rsa.pub\\\u0026#34;   A script handed over as user-data to the bastion ec2 instance, can be used to create the gardener user and add the ssh-key. For your convenience, you can use the following script to generate the user-data.\n  #!/bin/bash -eu saveUserDataFile () { ssh_key=$1 cat \u0026gt; gardener-bastion-userdata.sh \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF #!/bin/bash -eu id gardener || useradd gardener -mU mkdir -p /home/gardener/.ssh echo \u0026#34;$ssh_key\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /home/gardener/.ssh/authorized_keys chown gardener:gardener /home/gardener/.ssh/authorized_keys echo \u0026#34;gardener ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\u0026#34; \u0026gt;/etc/sudoers.d/99-gardener-user EOF } if [ -p /dev/stdin ]; then read -r input cat | saveUserDataFile \u0026#34;$input\u0026#34; else pbpaste | saveUserDataFile \u0026#34;$input\u0026#34; fi   Use the script by handing-over the public ssh-key of the Shoot cluster:\n$ kubectl get secret aws-gvisor.ssh-keypair -o json | jq -r .data.\\\u0026#34;id_rsa.pub\\\u0026#34; | ./generate-userdata.sh This generates a file called gardener-bastion-userdata.sh in the same directory containing the user-data.\n  The following information is needed to create the bastion instance:\nbastion-IAM-instance-profile-name\n Use the created instance profile with name \u0026lt;shoot-name\u0026gt;-bastions  image-id\n Possible use the same image-id as for the target instance (or any other image).

The AWSMachineClass contains the machine image (ami), machine-type, iam information, network-interfaces, subnets, security groups and attached volumes.\nOf course, the information can also be used to get the instance with the cloud provider CLI / API.\ngardenctl ssh Using the node name of the problematic instance, we can use the gardenctl ssh command to get SSH access to the cloud provider instance via an automatically set up bastion host. gardenctl takes care of spinning up the bastion instance, setting up the SSH keys, ports and security groups and opens a root shell on the target instance. After the SSH session has ended, gardenctl deletes the created cloud provider resources.\nUse the following commands:\nFirst, target a Garden cluster containing all the Shoot definitions.\n$ gardenctl target garden \u0026lt;target-garden\u0026gt; Target an available Shoot by name. This sets up the context, configures the kubeconfig file of the Shoot cluster and downloads the cloud provider credentials. Subsequent commands will execute in this context.\n$ gardenctl target shoot \u0026lt;target-shoot\u0026gt; This uses the cloud provider credentials to spin up the bastion and to open a shell on the target instance.\n$ gardenctl ssh \u0026lt;target-node\u0026gt; SSH with manually created Bastion on AWS In case you are not using gardenctl or want to control the bastion instance yourself, you can also manually set it up. The steps described here are generally the same as those used by gardenctl internally. Despite some cloud provider specifics they can be generalized to the following list:\n Open port 22 on the target instance. Create an instance / VM in a public subnet (bastion instance needs to have public ip address). Set-up security groups, roles and open port 22 for the bastion instance.  The following diagram shows an overview how the SSH access to the target instance works:\nThis guide demonstrates the setup of a bastion on AWS.\nPrerequisites:\n The AWS CLI is set up. Obtain target instance-id (see here). Obtain the VPC ID the Shoot resources are created in. This can be found in the Infrastructure CRD in the Shoot namespace in the Seed. Make sure that port 22 on the target instance is open (default for Gardener deployed instances).  Extract security group via  $ aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids \u0026lt;instance-id\u0026gt;  Check for rule that allows inbound connections on port 22:  $ aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids=\u0026lt;security-group-id\u0026gt;  If not available, create the rule with the following comamnd:  $ aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id \u0026lt;security-group-id\u0026gt; --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0   Create the Bastion Security Group   The common name of the security group is \u0026lt;shoot-name\u0026gt;-bsg. Create the security group:\n$ aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name \u0026lt;bastion-security-group-name\u0026gt; --description ssh-access --vpc-id \u0026lt;VPC-ID\u0026gt;   Optionally, create identifying tags for the security group:\n$ aws ec2 create-tags --resources \u0026lt;bastion-security-group-id\u0026gt; --tags Key=component,Value=\u0026lt;tag\u0026gt;   Create permission in the bastion security group that allows ssh access on port 22.\n$ aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id \u0026lt;bastion-security-group-id\u0026gt; --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0   Create an IAM role for the bastion instance with the name \u0026lt;shoot-name\u0026gt;-bastions:\n$ aws iam create-role --role-name \u0026lt;shoot-name\u0026gt;-bastions The content should be:\n  { \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;ec2:DescribeRegions\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; ] } ] }   Create the instance profile with name \u0026lt;shoot-name\u0026gt;-bastions:\n$ aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;   Add the created role to the instance profile:\n$ aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile --instance-profile-name \u0026lt;instance-profile-name\u0026gt; --role-name \u0026lt;role-name\u0026gt;   Create the bastion instance Next, in order to be able to ssh into the bastion instance, the instance has to be set up with a user with a public ssh key. Create a user gardener that has the same Gardener-generated public ssh key as the target instance.\n  First, we need to get the public part of the Shoot ssh-key. The ssh-key is stored in a secret in the the project namespace in the Garden cluster. The name is: \u0026lt;shoot-name\u0026gt;-ssh-publickey. Get the key via:\n$ kubectl get secret aws-gvisor.ssh-keypair -o json | jq -r .data.\\\u0026#34;id_rsa.pub\\\u0026#34;   A script handed over as user-data to the bastion ec2 instance, can be used to create the gardener user and add the ssh-key. For your convenience, you can use the following script to generate the user-data.\n  #!/bin/bash -eu saveUserDataFile () { ssh_key=$1 cat \u0026gt; gardener-bastion-userdata.sh \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF #!/bin/bash -eu id gardener || useradd gardener -mU mkdir -p /home/gardener/.ssh echo \u0026#34;$ssh_key\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /home/gardener/.ssh/authorized_keys chown gardener:gardener /home/gardener/.ssh/authorized_keys echo \u0026#34;gardener ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\u0026#34; \u0026gt;/etc/sudoers.d/99-gardener-user EOF } if [ -p /dev/stdin ]; then read -r input cat | saveUserDataFile \u0026#34;$input\u0026#34; else pbpaste | saveUserDataFile \u0026#34;$input\u0026#34; fi   Use the script by handing-over the public ssh-key of the Shoot cluster:\n$ kubectl get secret aws-gvisor.ssh-keypair -o json | jq -r .data.\\\u0026#34;id_rsa.pub\\\u0026#34; | ./generate-userdata.sh This generates a file called gardener-bastion-userdata.sh in the same directory containing the user-data.\n  The following information is needed to create the bastion instance:\nbastion-IAM-instance-profile-name\n Use the created instance profile with name \u0026lt;shoot-name\u0026gt;-bastions  image-id\n Possible use the same image-id as for the target instance (or any other image). Has cloud provider specific format (AWS: ami).  ssh-public-key-name\n This is the ssh key pair already created in the Shoot\u0026rsquo;s cloud provider account by Gardener during the Infrastructure CRD reconciliation. The name is usually: \u0026lt;shoot-name\u0026gt;-ssh-publickey  subnet-id\n Choose a subnet that is attached to an Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway (bastion instance must have a public IP). The Gardener created public subnet with the name \u0026lt;shoot-name\u0026gt;-public-utility-\u0026lt;xy\u0026gt; can be used. Please check the created subnets with the cloud provider.  bastion-security-group-id\n Use the id of the created bastion security group.  file-path-to-userdata\n  Use the filepath to user-data file generated in the previous step.\n  bastion-instance-name\n Optional to tag the instance. Usually \u0026lt;shoot-name\u0026gt;-bastions      Create the bastion instance via:\n  $ ec2 run-instances --iam-instance-profile Name=\u0026lt;bastion-IAM-instance-profile-name\u0026gt; --image-id \u0026lt;image-id\u0026gt; --count 1 --instance-type t3.nano --key-name \u0026lt;ssh-public-key-name\u0026gt; --security-group-ids \u0026lt;bastion-security-group-id\u0026gt; --subnet-id \u0026lt;subnet-id\u0026gt; --associate-public-ip-address --user-data \u0026lt;file-path-to-userdata\u0026gt; --tag-specifications ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=\u0026lt;bastion-instance-name\u0026gt;},{Key=component,Value=\u0026lt;mytag\u0026gt;}] ResourceType=volume,Tags=[{Key=component,Value=\u0026lt;mytag\u0026gt;}]\u0026#34; Capture the instance-id from the reponse and wait until the ec2 instance is running and has a public ip address.\nConnecting to the target instance Save the private key of the ssh-key-pair in a temporary local file for later use.\n$ umask 077 $ kubectl get secret \u0026lt;shoot-name\u0026gt;.ssh-keypair -o json | jq -r .data.\\\u0026#34;id_rsa\\\u0026#34; | base64 -d \u0026gt; id_rsa.key Use the private ssh key to ssh into the bastion instance.\n$ ssh -i \u0026lt;path-to-private-key\u0026gt; gardener@\u0026lt;public-bastion-instance-ip\u0026gt; If that works, connect from your local terminal to the target instance via the bastion.\n$ ssh -i \u0026lt;path-to-private-key\u0026gt; -o ProxyCommand=\u0026#34;ssh -W %h:%p -i \u0026lt;private-key\u0026gt; -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no gardener@\u0026lt;public-ip-bastion\u0026gt;\u0026#34; gardener@\u0026lt;private-ip-target-instance\u0026gt; -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no Cleanup Do not forget to cleanup the created resources.

Are there any log files? Where? How could I debug a pod?","content":"Introduction Kubernetes offers powerful options to get more details about startup or runtime failures of pods as e.g. described in Application Introspection and Debugging or Debug Pods and Replication Controllers.\nIn order to identify pods with potential issus you could e.g. run kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep -iv Running  to filter out the pods which are not in the state Running. One of frequent error state is CrashLoopBackOff, which tells that a pod crashes right after the start. Kubernetes then tries to restart the pod, but often the pod startup fails again.\nHere is a short list of possible reasons which might lead to a pod crash:\n error during image pull caused by e.g. wrong/missing secrets or wrong/missing image the app runs in an error state caused e.g. by missing environmental variables (ConfigMaps) or secrets liveness probe failed too high resource consumption (memory and/or CPU) or too strict quota settings persistent volumes can\u0026rsquo;t be created/mounted the container image is not updated  Basically, the commands kubectl logs ... and kubectl describe ... with additional parameters are used to get more detailed information. By calling e.g. kubectl logs --help you get more detailed information about the command and its parameters.\nIn the next sections you\u0026rsquo;ll find some basic approaches to get some ideas what went wrong.\nRemarks:\n Even if the pods seem to be running as the status Running indicates, a high counter of the Restarts shows potential problems There is as well an interactive Tutorial Troubleshooting with Kubectl available which explains basic debugging activities The examples below are deployed into the namespace default. In case you want to change it use the optional parameter --namespace \u0026lt;your-namespace\u0026gt; to select the target namespace. They require Kubernetes release ≥ 1.8.  Prerequisites Your deployment was successful (no logical/syntactical errors in the manifest files), but the pod(s) aren\u0026rsquo;t running.\nError caused by wrong image name You run kubectl describe pod \u0026lt;your-pod\u0026gt; \u0026lt;your-namespace\u0026gt; to get detailed information about the pod startup.\nIn the Events section, you get an error message like Failed to pull image ... and Reason: Failed. The pod is in state ImagePullBackOff.\nThe example below is based on demo in Kubernetes documentation.

Prerequisites Your deployment was successful (no logical/syntactical errors in the manifest files), but the pod(s) aren\u0026rsquo;t running.\nError caused by wrong image name You run kubectl describe pod \u0026lt;your-pod\u0026gt; \u0026lt;your-namespace\u0026gt; to get detailed information about the pod startup.\nIn the Events section, you get an error message like Failed to pull image ... and Reason: Failed. The pod is in state ImagePullBackOff.\nThe example below is based on demo in Kubernetes documentation. In all examples the default namespace is used.\nFirst, cleanup with\nkubectl delete pod termination-demo Next, create a resource based on the yaml content below\napiVersion:v1kind:Podmetadata:name:termination-demospec:containers:- name:termination-demo-containerimage:debianncommand:[\u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;]args:[\u0026#34;-c\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;sleep 10 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; echo Sleep expired \u0026gt; /dev/termination-log\u0026#34;]kubectl describe pod termination-demo lists the following content in the Event section\nEvents: FirstSeen\tLastSeen\tCount\tFrom\tSubObjectPath\tType\tReason\tMessage ---------\t--------\t-----\t----\t-------------\t--------\t------\t------- 2m\t2m\t1\tdefault-scheduler\tNormal\tScheduled\tSuccessfully assigned termination-demo to ip-10-250-17-112.eu-west-1.compute.internal 2m\t2m\t1\tkubelet, ip-10-250-17-112.eu-west-1.compute.internal\tNormal\tSuccessfulMountVolume\tMountVolume.SetUp succeeded for volume \u0026#34;default-token-sgccm\u0026#34; 2m\t1m\t4\tkubelet, ip-10-250-17-112.eu-west-1.compute.internal\tspec.containers{termination-demo-container}\tNormal\tPulling\tpulling image \u0026#34;debiann\u0026#34; 2m\t1m\t4\tkubelet, ip-10-250-17-112.eu-west-1.compute.internal\tspec.containers{termination-demo-container}\tWarning\tFailed\tFailed to pull image \u0026#34;debiann\u0026#34;: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Error: image library/debiann:latest not found 2m\t54s\t10\tkubelet, ip-10-250-17-112.eu-west-1.compute.internal\tWarning\tFailedSync\tError syncing pod 2m\t54s\t6\tkubelet, ip-10-250-17-112.eu-west-1.compute.internal\tspec.containers{termination-demo-container}\tNormal\tBackOff\tBack-off pulling image \u0026#34;debiann\u0026#34; The error message with Reason: Failed tells that there is an error during pulling the image.

In this case, you get an output like\n/bin/sh: 1: cannot open : No such file So you need to have a closer look at the application. In this case the environmental variable MYFILEis missing. To fix this issue you could e.g. add a ConfigMap to your deployment as it is shown in the manifest listed below.\napiVersion:v1kind:ConfigMapmetadata:name:app-envdata:MYFILE:\u0026#34;/etc/profile\u0026#34;---apiVersion:apps/v1kind:Deploymentmetadata:name:termination-demolabels:app:termination-demospec:replicas:1selector:matchLabels:app:termination-demotemplate:metadata:labels:app:termination-demospec:containers:- name:termination-demo-containerimage:debiancommand:[\u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;]args:[\u0026#34;-c\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;sed \\\u0026#34;s/foo/bar/\\\u0026#34; \u0026lt; $MYFILE\u0026#34;]envFrom:- configMapRef:name:app-envNote that once you fix the error and re-run the scenario, you might still see the pod in CrashLoopBackOff status. It is because the container finishes the command sed ... and runs to completion. In order to keep the container in Running status, a long running task is required, e.g.\napiVersion:v1kind:ConfigMapmetadata:name:app-envdata:MYFILE:\u0026#34;/etc/profile\u0026#34;SLEEP:\u0026#34;5\u0026#34;---apiVersion:apps/v1kind:Deploymentmetadata:name:termination-demolabels:app:termination-demospec:replicas:1selector:matchLabels:app:termination-demotemplate:metadata:labels:app:termination-demospec:containers:- name:termination-demo-containerimage:debiancommand:[\u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;]# args: [\u0026#34;-c\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sed \\\u0026#34;s/foo/bar/\\\u0026#34; \u0026lt; $MYFILE\u0026#34;]args:[\u0026#34;-c\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;while true; do sleep $SLEEP; echo sleeping; done;\u0026#34;]envFrom:- configMapRef:name:app-envToo high resource consumption or too strict quota settings You can optionally specify the amount of memory and/or CPU your container gets during runtime. In case these settings are missing, the default requests settings are taken: CPU: 0m (in Milli CPU) and RAM: 0Gi which indicate no other limits than the ones of the node(s) itself. Find more details in Configure Default Memory Requests and Limits for a Namespace,\nIn case your application needs more resources, Kubernetes distinguishes between requests and limit settings: requests specify the guaranteed amount of resource, whereas limit tells Kubernetes the maximum amount of resource the container might need. Mathematically both settings could be described by the relation 0 \u0026lt;= requests \u0026lt;= limit. For both settings you need to consider the total amount of resources the available nodes provide. For a detailed description of the concept see Resource Quality of Service in Kubernetes.\nUse kubectl describe nodes to get a first overview of the resource consumption of your cluster. Of special interest are the figures indicating the amount of CPU and Memory Requests at the bottom of the output.\nThe next example demonstrates what happens in case the CPU request is too high in order to be managed by your cluster.\nFirst, cleanup with\nkubectldeletedeploymenttermination-demokubectldeleteconfigmapsapp-envNext, adapt the cpu in the yaml below to be slightly higher than the remaining cpu resources in your cluster and deploy this manifest. In this example 600m (milli CPUs) are requested in a Kubernetes system with a single 2 Core worker node which results in an error message.\napiVersion:apps/v1kind:Deploymentmetadata:name:termination-demolabels:app:termination-demospec:replicas:1selector:matchLabels:app:termination-demotemplate:metadata:labels:app:termination-demospec:containers:- name:termination-demo-containerimage:debiancommand:[\u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;]args:[\u0026#34;-c\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;sleep 10 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; echo Sleep expired \u0026gt; /dev/termination-log\u0026#34;]resources:requests:cpu:\u0026#34;600m\u0026#34;The command kubectl get pods lists the pod termination-demo-xxx in the state Pending. More details on why this happens could be found by using the command kubectl describe pod termination-demo-xxx:\n$ kubectl describe po termination-demo-fdb7bb7d9-mzvfw Name: termination-demo-fdb7bb7d9-mzvfw Namespace: default ...

More details in\n Managing Compute Resources for Containters Resource Quality of Service in Kubernetes  Remark:\n This example works similarly when specifying a too high request for memory In case you configured an autoscaler range when creating your Kubernetes cluster another worker node will be started automatically if you didn\u0026rsquo;t reach the maximum number of worker nodes If your app is running out of memory (the memory settings are too small), you typically find OOMKilled (Out Of Memory) message in the Events section fo the kubectl describe pod ... output  Why was the container image not updated? You applied a fix in your app, created a new container image and pushed it into your container repository. After redeploying your Kubernetes manifests you expected to get the updated app, but still the same bug is in the new deployment present.\nThis behavior is related to how Kubernetes decides whether to pull a new docker image or to use the cached one.\nIn case you didn\u0026rsquo;t change the image tag, the default image policy IfNotPresent tells Kubernetes to use the cached image (see Images).\nAs a best practice you should not use the tag latest and change the image tag whenever you changed anything in your image (see Configuration Best Practices).\nFind more details in FAQ Container Image not updating\nLinks  Application Introspection and Debugging Debug Pods and Replication Controllers Logging Architecture Configure Default Memory Requests and Limits for a Namespace Managing Compute Resources for Containters Resource Quality of Service in Kubernetes Interactive Tutorial Troubleshooting with Kubectl Images Kubernetes Best Practises  "},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/documentation/guides/applications/https/","title":"HTTPS with self Signed Certificate","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Configuring ingress with front-end TLS It is alyways recommended to enable encryption for services to prevent traffic interception and man-in-the-middle attacks - even in DEV environments.\nYou should configure front-end Transport Layer Security (TLS) so that the ingress controller can secure access to a service from the client to the load balancer by using HTTPS.\nWe will use basic procedure here.

Examples for that are networks, routing entries, security groups, IAM roles, etc. Before introducing the Infrastructure extension resource Gardener was using Terraform in order to create and manage these provider-specific resources (e.g., see here). Now, Gardener commissions an external, provider-specific controller to take over this task.\nWhich infrastructure resources are required? Unfortunately, there is no general answer to this question as it is highly provider specific. Consider the above mentioned resources, i.e. VPC, subnets, route tables, security groups, IAM roles, SSH key pairs. Most of the resources are required in order to create VMs (the shoot cluster worker nodes), load balancers, and volumes.\nWhat needs to be implemented to support a new infrastructure provider? As part of the shoot flow Gardener will create a special CRD in the seed cluster that needs to be reconciled by an extension controller, for example:\n---apiVersion:extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Infrastructuremetadata:name:infrastructurenamespace:shoot--foo--barspec:type:azureregion:eu-west-1secretRef:name:cloudprovidernamespace:shoot--foo--barproviderConfig:apiVersion:azure.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:InfrastructureConfigresourceGroup:name:mygroupnetworks:vnet:# specify either \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; or \u0026#39;cidr\u0026#39;# name: my-vnetcidr:10.250.0.0/16workers:10.250.0.0/19The .spec.secretRef contains a reference to the provider secret pointing to the account that shall be used to create the needed resources. However, the most important section is the .spec.providerConfig. It contains an embedded declaration of the provider specific configuration for the infrastructure (that cannot be known by Gardener itself). You are responsible for designing how this configuration looks like. Gardener does not evaluate it but just copies this part from what has been provided by the end-user in the Shoot resource.\nAfter your controller has created the required resources in your provider\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure it needs to generate an output that can be used by other controllers in subsequent steps. An example for that is the Worker extension resource controller. It is responsible for creating virtual machines (shoot worker nodes) in this prepared infrastructure. Everything that it needs to know in order to do that (e.g., the network IDs, security group names, etc. (again: provider-specific)) needs to be provided as output in the Infrastructure resource:\n---apiVersion:extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Infrastructuremetadata:name:infrastructurenamespace:shoot--foo--barspec:...status:lastOperation:...providerStatus:apiVersion:azure.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:InfrastructureStatusresourceGroup:name:mygroupnetworks:vnet:name:my-vnetsubnets:- purpose:nodesname:my-subnetavailabilitySets:- purpose:nodesid:av-set-idname:av-set-namerouteTables:- purpose:nodesname:route-table-namesecurityGroups:- purpose:nodesname:sec-group-nameIn order to support a new infrastructure provider you need to write a controller that watches all Infrastructures with .spec.type=\u0026lt;my-provider-name\u0026gt;. You can take a look at the below referenced example implementation for the Azure provider.\nDynamic nodes network for shoot clusters Some environments do not allow end-users to statically define a CIDR for the network that shall be used for the shoot worker nodes. In these cases it is possible for the extension controllers to dynamically provision a network for the nodes (as part of their reconciliation loops), and to provide the CIDR in the status of the Infrastructure resource:\n---apiVersion:extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Infrastructuremetadata:name:infrastructurenamespace:shoot--foo--barspec:...status:lastOperation:...providerStatus:...nodesCIDR:10.250.0.0/16Gardener will pick this nodesCIDR and use it to configure the VPN components to establish network connectivity between the control plane and the worker nodes. If the Shoot resource already specifies a nodes CIDR in .spec.networking.nodes and the extension controller provides also a value in .status.nodesCIDR in the Infrastructure resource then the latter one will always be considered with higher priority by Gardener.\nNon-provider specific information required for infrastructure creation Some providers might require further information that is not provider specific but already part of the shoot resource. One example for this is the GCP infrastructure controller which needs the pod and the service network of the cluster in order to prepare and configure the infrastructure correctly. As Gardener cannot know which information is required by providers it simply mirrors the Shoot, Seed, and CloudProfile resources into the seed. They are part of the Cluster extension resource and can be used to extract information that is not part of the Infrastructure resource itself.\nReferences and additional resources  Infrastructure API (Golang specification) Exemplary implementation for the Azure provider  "},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/v1.12.8/concepts/extensions/infrastructure/","title":"Infrastructure resource","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Contract: Infrastructure resource Every Kubernetes cluster requires some low-level infrastructure to be setup in order to work properly.

Everything that it needs to know in order to do that (e.g., the network IDs, security group names, etc. (again: provider-specific)) needs to be provided as output in the Infrastructure resource:\n---apiVersion:extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Infrastructuremetadata:name:infrastructurenamespace:shoot--foo--barspec:...status:lastOperation:...providerStatus:apiVersion:azure.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:InfrastructureStatusresourceGroup:name:mygroupnetworks:vnet:name:my-vnetsubnets:- purpose:nodesname:my-subnetavailabilitySets:- purpose:nodesid:av-set-idname:av-set-namerouteTables:- purpose:nodesname:route-table-namesecurityGroups:- purpose:nodesname:sec-group-nameIn order to support a new infrastructure provider you need to write a controller that watches all Infrastructures with .spec.type=\u0026lt;my-provider-name\u0026gt;. You can take a look at the below referenced example implementation for the Azure provider.\nDynamic nodes network for shoot clusters Some environments do not allow end-users to statically define a CIDR for the network that shall be used for the shoot worker nodes. In these cases it is possible for the extension controllers to dynamically provision a network for the nodes (as part of their reconciliation loops), and to provide the CIDR in the status of the Infrastructure resource:\n---apiVersion:extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Infrastructuremetadata:name:infrastructurenamespace:shoot--foo--barspec:...status:lastOperation:...providerStatus:...nodesCIDR:10.250.0.0/16Gardener will pick this nodesCIDR and use it to configure the VPN components to establish network connectivity between the control plane and the worker nodes. If the Shoot resource already specifies a nodes CIDR in .spec.networking.nodes and the extension controller provides also a value in .status.nodesCIDR in the Infrastructure resource then the latter one will always be considered with higher priority by Gardener.\nNon-provider specific information required for infrastructure creation Some providers might require further information that is not provider specific but already part of the shoot resource. One example for this is the GCP infrastructure controller which needs the pod and the service network of the cluster in order to prepare and configure the infrastructure correctly. As Gardener cannot know which information is required by providers it simply mirrors the Shoot, Seed, and CloudProfile resources into the seed. They are part of the Cluster extension resource and can be used to extract information that is not part of the Infrastructure resource itself.\nReferences and additional resources  Infrastructure API (Golang specification) Exemplary implementation for the Azure provider  "},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/v1.13.2/concepts/extensions/infrastructure/","title":"Infrastructure resource","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Contract: Infrastructure resource Every Kubernetes cluster requires some low-level infrastructure to be setup in order to work properly. Examples for that are networks, routing entries, security groups, IAM roles, etc. Before introducing the Infrastructure extension resource Gardener was using Terraform in order to create and manage these provider-specific resources (e.g., see here). Now, Gardener commissions an external, provider-specific controller to take over this task.\nWhich infrastructure resources are required? Unfortunately, there is no general answer to this question as it is highly provider specific. Consider the above mentioned resources, i.e. VPC, subnets, route tables, security groups, IAM roles, SSH key pairs. Most of the resources are required in order to create VMs (the shoot cluster worker nodes), load balancers, and volumes.\nWhat needs to be implemented to support a new infrastructure provider? As part of the shoot flow Gardener will create a special CRD in the seed cluster that needs to be reconciled by an extension controller, for example:\n---apiVersion:extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Infrastructuremetadata:name:infrastructurenamespace:shoot--foo--barspec:type:azureregion:eu-west-1secretRef:name:cloudprovidernamespace:shoot--foo--barproviderConfig:apiVersion:azure.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:InfrastructureConfigresourceGroup:name:mygroupnetworks:vnet:# specify either \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; or \u0026#39;cidr\u0026#39;# name: my-vnetcidr:10.250.0.0/16workers:10.250.0.0/19The .spec.secretRef contains a reference to the provider secret pointing to the account that shall be used to create the needed resources. However, the most important section is the .spec.providerConfig. It contains an embedded declaration of the provider specific configuration for the infrastructure (that cannot be known by Gardener itself). You are responsible for designing how this configuration looks like. Gardener does not evaluate it but just copies this part from what has been provided by the end-user in the Shoot resource.\nAfter your controller has created the required resources in your provider\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure it needs to generate an output that can be used by other controllers in subsequent steps.

In particular, when communicating over an untrusted medium such as the internet, it is critical to ensure the integrity and immutability of all the data a system operates on. Especially if you use Docker Engine to push and pull images (data) to a public registry.\nThis immutability offers me a guarantee that any and all containers that I instantiate will be absolutely identical at inception. Surprise surprise, deterministic operations.\nA Lesson in Deterministic Ops Docker Tags are about as reliable and disposable as this guy down here.\nSeems simple enough. You have probably already deployed hundreds of YAML\u0026rsquo;s or started endless count of Docker container.\ndocker run --name mynginx1 -P -d nginx:1.13.9 or\napiVersion:apps/v1kind:Deploymentmetadata:name:rss-sitespec:replicas:1selector:matchLabels:app:webtemplate:metadata:labels:app:webspec:containers:- name:front-endimage:nginx:1.13.9ports:- containerPort:80But Tags are mutable and humans are prone to error. Not a good combination. Here we’ll dig into why the use of tags can be dangerous and how to deploy your containers across a pipeline and across environments, you guessed it, with determinism in mind.\nI want to ensure that whether it’s today or 5 years from now, that specific deployment uses the very same image that I defined. Any updates or newer versions of an image should be executed as a new deployment. The solution: digest\nA digest takes the place of the tag when pulling an image, for example, to pull the above image by digest, run the following command:\ndocker run --name mynginx1 -P -d nginx@sha256:4771d09578c7c6a65299e110b3ee1c0a2592f5ea2618d23e4ffe7a4cab1ce5de You can now make sure that the same image is always loaded at every deployment. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if the TAG of the image has been changed or not. This solves the problem of repeatability.\nContent Trust However, there’s an additionally hidden danger.

If a container is compromised, the root user in the container has full control over the underlying node.\nWatch the very good presentation by Liz Rice at the KubeCon 2018\n Use RUN groupadd -r anygroup \u0026amp;\u0026amp; useradd -r -g anygroup myuser to create a group and add a user to it. Use the USER command to switch to this user. Note that you may also consider to provide an explicit UID/GID if required.\nFor Example:\nARG GF_UID=\u0026#34;500\u0026#34; ARG GF_GID=\u0026#34;500\u0026#34; # add group \u0026amp; user RUN groupadd -r -g $GF_GID appgroup \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ useradd appuser -r -u $GF_UID -g appgroup USER appuser Store data or logs in containers Containers are ideal for stateless applications and should be transient. This means that no data or logs should be stored in the container, as they are lost when the container is closed. Use persistence volumes instead to persist data outside of containers. Using an ELK stack is another good option for storing and processing logs.\nUsing pod IP addresses Each pod is assigned an IP address. It is necessary for pods to communicate with each other to build an application, e.g. an application must communicate with a database. Existing pods are terminated and new pods are constantly started. If you would rely on the IP address of a pod or container, you would need to update the application configuration constantly. This makes the application fragile. Create services instead. They provide a logical name that can be assigned independently of the varying number and IP addresses of containers. Services are the basic concept for load balancing within Kubernetes.\nMore than one process in a container A docker file provides a CMD and ENTRYPOINT to start the image. CMD is often used around a script that makes a configuration and then starts the container. Do not try to start multiple processes with this script. It is important to consider the separation of concerns when creating docker images. Running multiple processes in a single pod makes managing your containers, collecting logs and updating each process more difficult. You can split the image into multiple containers and manage them independently - even in one pod. Bear in mind that Kubernetes only monitors the process with PID=1. If more than one process is started within a container, then these no longer fall under the control of Kubernetes.\nCreating images in a running container A new image can be created with the docker commit command. This is useful if changes have been made to the container and you want to persist them for later error analysis. However, images created like this are not reproducible and completely worthless for a CI/CD environment. Furthermore, another developer cannot recognize which components the image contains. Instead, always make changes to the docker file, close existing containers and start a new container with the updated image.\nSaving passwords in docker image 💀 Do not save passwords in a Docker file. They are in plain text and are checked into a repository. That makes them completely vulnerable even if you are using a private repository like the Artifactory. Always use Secrets or ConfigMaps to provision passwords or inject them by mounting a persistent volume.\nUsing the \u0026lsquo;latest\u0026rsquo; tag Starting an image with tomcat is tempting. If no tags are specified, a container is started with the tomcat:latest image. This image may no longer be up to date and refers to an older version instead. Running a production application requires complete control of the environment with exact versions of the image. Make sure you always use a tag or even better the sha256 hash of the image e.g. tomcat@sha256:c34ce3c1fcc0c7431e1392cc3abd0dfe2192ffea1898d5250f199d3ac8d8720f. Why use the sha256 hash? Tags are not immutable and can be overwritten by a developer at any time. In this case you don\u0026rsquo;t have complete control over your image - which is bad.\nDifferent images per environment Don\u0026rsquo;t create different images for development, testing, staging and production environments. The image should be the source of truth and should only be created once and pushed to the repository. This image:tag should be used for different environments in the future.\nDepend on start order of pods Applications often depend on containers being started in a certain order. For example, a database container must be up and running before an application can connect to it. The application should be resilient to such changes, as the db pod can be unreachable or restarted at any time. The application container should be able to handle such situations without terminating or crashing.\nAdditional anti-patterns and patterns\u0026hellip; In the community vast experience have been collected to improve stability and usability of Docker and Kubernetes.

The installation scripts in this repo are embedded in a configuration template in the landscape-setup-template project. You can find further information there.\nWe do recommend this simplified setup for demonstration purposes only. For productive workloads we do recommend that all components (Gardener/Seed/Shoot) run in their own IaaS accounts and that network policies are enabled and properly tested on the seed clusters.

A Linux machine (virtual machine is fine) or a Mac with basic tools such as a git client and the Docker runtime installed.  Gardener Installation Follow these steps to install Gardener. Do not proceed to the next step in case of errors.\nTL;DR If you are already familiar with the installation procedure and just want a short summary of the commands you have to use, here it is:\n# setup git clone --recursive https://github.com/gardener/landscape-setup-template.git landscape # fill in landscape/landscape_config.yaml now cd landscape/setup ./docker_run.sh deploy all # ------------------------------------------------------------------- # teardown undeploy all ./cleanup.sh Otherwise, follow the detailed guide below.\nKubectl Aliases The following aliases can be used within the docker container:\nk =\u0026gt; kubectl ks =\u0026gt; kubectl -n kube-system kg =\u0026gt; kubectl -n garden kn =\u0026gt; kubectl -n ka =\u0026gt; kubectl get --all-namespaces Bash completion works for all of them except for ka.\nStep 1: Clone the Repositories and get Dependencies Get the landscape-setup-template from GitHub and initialize the submodules:\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/gardener/landscape-setup-template.git landscape cd landscape After step 2, this repository will contain all passwords and keys for your landscape. You will be in trouble if you loose them so we recommend that you store this landscape configuration in a private repository. It might be a good idea to change the origin so you do not accidentally publish your secrets to the public template repository.\nSubmodule Management This project needs the Gardener and dashboard as submodules. To avoid conflicts between the checked out versions and the ones specified in the landscape_base.yaml file, automatic version management has been added. As long as the managed field in the chart area of each submodule is set to true, the version specified in the tag field will be checked out before deploying.\nTo check vor the correct version, the VERSION file in the submodule\u0026rsquo;s main folder is read and compared to the tag in the config file. If the VERSION file doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, the component is added as a submodule. If it exists, but the versions differ, the fitting version will be checked out. If it exists and the versions are identical, nothing is done. The automatic version management will fail if a) the component is already added as a submodule, but the VERSION file is missing or b) the landscape folder is not a git repo.\nIt is also possible to trigger the version update manually: call the manage_submodule function with gardener or dashboard as an argument, or run the manage_submodules.sh script which will update Gardener and dashboard. Both will only work from inside the docker container / with sourced init.sh file.\nStep 2: Configure the Landscape There is a landscape_config.yaml file in the landscape project. This is the only file that you need to modify - all other configuration files will be derived from this and the landscape_base.yaml file. The latter one contains the merging instructions as well as technical configurations and it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be touched unless you know what you are doing.\nBuilding the \u0026lsquo;landscape.yaml\u0026rsquo; File Both config files - landscape_config.yaml and landscape_base.yaml - are merged into one landscape.yaml file which is then used as configuration for the scripts. Sourcing the init.sh file (which happens automatically when entering the docker image) will perform this merge unless the file already exists. This means if you change something in one of the original config files after the landscape.yaml file has already been created, you need to manually rebuild it in order for the changes to take effect.\n./build_landscape_yaml.sh This script will recreate the landscape.yaml file. It will also source the init.sh file again, as some of the environment variables are extracted from this file.\nThe Base Cluster Gardener extends the Kubernetes apiserver, so in order to deploy it, you need a Kubernetes cluster first. This setup gives you two options for this:\nKubify You can use Kubify to create the initial cluster. Kubify uses Terraform to create the cluster and it is integrated into this project - you don\u0026rsquo;t need to create the cluster yourself, just make sure you fill out all relevant parts of the config file.\nShoot Cluster A shoot cluster is a cluster created by a Gardener instance and it can be used as a base cluster for this project. These flags have to be set for the kube-apiserver (if not set, the Gardener will still work, but the dashboard won\u0026rsquo;t):\n--oidc-issuer-url=https://identity.ingress.\u0026lt;yourclusterdomain\u0026gt;--oidc-client-id=kube-kubectl--oidc-username-claim=email--oidc-groups-claim=groupsFor a shoot this can be done by setting issuerUrl, clientID, usernameClaim, and groupsClaim in spec.kubernetes.kubeAPIServer.oidcConfig in the shoot manifest.\nAlso make sure that the CIDRs of your base cluster and the from your Gardener spawned shoots don\u0026rsquo;t overlap - if you want to be able to create shoots from the Gardener dashboard later, then don\u0026rsquo;t use the default CIDRs for this base cluster.\nSome fields in the landscape_config.yaml are marked with # kubify only, they can be ignored when using a shoot as the base cluster. The etcd server address defaults to the address for Kubify and needs to be changed for the shoot setup (see the comments in the config file).\nThe kubeconfig for the base cluster is expected to be named kubeconfig and reside in the directory containing this project\u0026rsquo;s directory (next to the landscape_config.yaml file).\nUsing an Arbitrary Base Cluster While this setup has only been tested for clusters created by Kubify or the Gardener (shoot clusters), it is theoretically possible to use the shoot setup method to deploy the Gardener to an arbitrary kubernetes cluster.\nStep 3: Build and Run Docker Container First, cd into the folder containing this project.\nThen run the container:\n./docker_run.sh After this,\n you will be connected to the container via an interactive shell the landscape folder will be mounted in that container your current working directory will be setup folder setup/init.sh is sourced, meaning  the environment variables will be set kubectl will be configured to communicate with your cluster landscape.yaml file will have been created if it didn\u0026rsquo;t exist before    The docker_run.sh script searches for the image locally and pulls it from an image repository, if it isn\u0026rsquo;t found. If pulling the image doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for whatever reason, you can use the docker_build.sh script to build the image locally.\nStep 4-10: Deploying Components The Gardener deployment is splitted into components. A single component can be easily deployed using\ndeploy \u0026lt;component name\u0026gt; Please take care that most of the components depend on each other and therefore have to be deployed in the order given below.\nThe deploy command is added to the PATH environment variable and can thus be called from anywhere. Bash auto-completion can be used for the component names.\nUndeploying Components It is also possible to \u0026ldquo;undeploy\u0026rdquo; a component using\nundeploy \u0026lt;component name\u0026gt; Components need to be undeployed in the inverse order. Do not undeploy components without undeploying their successors in the component order first. Take care to delete all shoots before undeploying the gardener or seed-config components (although both undeploy scripts will check for that and trigger a deletion themselves).\nThe \u0026lsquo;all\u0026rsquo; Component The all component is a special component: it serves as a dummy to deploy several components in one go. Usually, manual intervention between deploying components is not necessary and most of them are deployed directly one after the other, so the all component makes the \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; use-case easier.\nFor better control which components are deployed, a component range can be given as an argument. The argument should have the form \u0026lt;start component name\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;end component name\u0026gt; and then the start component, the end component, and all components in between will be deployed. The order of the arguments is taken from the environment variables with the $COMPONENT_ORDER_ prefix. The variable with the suffix that matches the clusters.base_cluster entry in the config file will be used.\nIt is also possible to drop one part of the range or to drop the whole argument. For missing parts the defaults will be used, which are the first and the last component of the active component order, respectively.\nThe undeploy command can also be used with the all component, but take care that the component order is inverted.\n# Examples # (start and end component are always inclusive) deploy all # deploys all components deploy all gardener:dashboard # deploys \u0026#39;gardener\u0026#39; through \u0026#39;dashboard\u0026#39; deploy all gardener: # deploys all components starting from \u0026#39;gardener\u0026#39; deploy all :gardener # deploys all components up to \u0026#39;gardener\u0026#39; # (all undeploy commands use the inverse component order) undeploy all # undeploys all components undeploy all :helm-tiller # undeploys all components up to \u0026#39;helm-tiller\u0026#39; undeploy all dashboard:cert # undeploys \u0026#39;dashboard\u0026#39; through \u0026#39;cert\u0026#39; Step 4-10: Deploying Components (detailed) Step 4: Kubify / etcd If you want to create a Kubify cluster, deploy the component:\ndeploy kubify The script will wait some time for the cluster to come up and then partly validate that the cluster is ready.\nIf you get errors during the cluster setup, just try to run the command again.\nOnce completed the following command should show all deployed pods:\nroot@c41327633d6d:/landscape# kubectl get pods --all-namespaces NAMESPACE NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE kube-system etcd-operator-75dcfcf4f7-xkm4h 1/1 Running 0 6m kube-system heapster-c8fb4f746-tvts6 2/2 Running 0 2m kube-system kube-apiserver-hcdnc 1/1 Running 0 6m [...]  If you already have a cluster, you don\u0026rsquo;t need Kubify. To deploy an etcd in your cluster, run\ndeploy etcd This component is not meant to be used in combination with Kubify and might require manual steps to make it work.\nIt should also be possible to plug in your own etcd - check the deploy scripts for the etcd and gardener components for information on where to put the certificates, etc.\nStep 5: Generate Certificates This step will generate a self-signed cluster CA and sign some certificates with it.\ndeploy cert Step 6: Deploy tiller Tiller is needed to deploy the Helm charts of Gardener and other components.\ndeploy helm-tiller Step 7: Deploy Gardener Now we can deploy Gardener. If the previous steps were executed successfully this should be completed in a couple of seconds.\ndeploy gardener You might see a couple of messages like these:\nGardener API server not yet reachable. Waiting... while the script waits for the Gardener to start. Once Gardener is up when the deployment script finished you can verify the correct setup by running the following command:\nkubectl get shoots No resources found. As we do not have a seed cluster yet we cannot create any shoot clusters. The Gardener itself is installed in the garden namespace:\nkubectl get po -n garden NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE gardener-apiserver-56cc665667-nvrjl 1/1 Running 0 6m gardener-controller-manager-5c9f8db55-hfcts 1/1 Running 0 6m Step 8: Register Garden Cluster as Seed Cluster In heterogeneous productive environments one would run Gardener and seed in separate clusters but for simplicity and resource consumption reasons we will register the Gardener cluster that we have just created also as the seed cluster. Make sure that the seed_config in the landscape file is correct and matches the region that you are using. Keep in mind that image ids differ between regions as well. Also, valid credentials for the seed provider have to be specified in the authentication part of the landscape_config.yaml file (the etcd backups of the shoot clusters are stored on the seed).\ndeploy seed-config Configuring Additional Seeds By default, this step will create a seed for the cloud provider the Gardener has been deployed on and thus creating shoots on this provider will be possible. If you want to create shoots on other cloud providers, you will have to configure additional seeds. There are two options for that:\nIf the seed-config deploy script is called without any arguments (as shown above), it will create seeds for all providers specified in the seed_config.seeds section in the landscape_config.yaml file. By default, the only entry in that list is the cloud provider chosen for the Gardener cluster, but you can extend the list.\nIt is also possible to provide the seed-config deploy script with additional arguments specifying which seeds should be created. Multiple arguments can be given and the script will ignore the list in the landscape_config.yaml file when called with arguments. Only the specified seeds will be created, already existing seeds are not affected. If a given seed already exists, it will be updated to the current configuration.\nIn both cases, the corresponding variant nodes in authentication and seed_config have to be filled out in the config file.\nValid values for seeds are aws, az (for Azure), gcp, and openstack. Please note, that while it is possible to create seeds for any cloud provider on any cloud provider, shoot creation may not work across cloud providers for every combination. It should always work if seed (Gardener cluster in this setup) and shoot are on the same provider, though.\nCreating a Shoot That\u0026rsquo;s it! If everything went fine you should now be able to create shoot clusters. You can start with a sample manifest and create a shoot cluster by standard Kubernetes means:\nkubectl apply -f shoot-aws.yaml Step 9: Install Identity and Dashboard Creating clusters based on a shoot manifest is quite nice but also a little complex. While almost all aspects of a shoot cluster can be configured, it can be quite difficult for beginners, so go on and install the dashboard:\ndeploy identity [...] deploy dashboard [...] Create CNAME Entry Dashboard and identity need a CNAME entry pointing the domain *.ingress.\u0026lt;your cluster domain\u0026gt; to your cluster\u0026rsquo;s nginx ingress ip/hostname. Kubify creates this entry automatically. If you are not using kubify to create your base cluster, you can create the CNAME entry with the corresponding component:\ndeploy cname The script uses the AWS CLI to create the entry, so it will only work for route53.\nStep 10: Apply Valid Certificates The following command will install the cert-manager and request valid letsencrypt certificates for both the identity and dashboard ingresses:\ndeploy certmanager After a few minutes valid certificates should be installed.\nLetsencrypt Quota Limits Letsencrypt limits how many certificates you can get for the same host within a short time. To avoid hitting these limits, you can use the letsencrypt staging server for testing, which has a significantly higher rate limit but produces untrusted certificates.\nThe charts.[certmanager].live field in the config file allows to switch between live and staging server (remember to rebuild the landscape.yaml file after you changed something in the landscape_config.yaml file).\nAccessing the Dashboard After step 9 you will be able to access the Gardener dashboard. There is a difference in how you access it depending on whether you used the letsencrypt live server or the staging one (and thus have untrusted credentials in the latter case).\nThe print_dashboard_urls.sh script constructs two URLs from the domain name given in the landscape.yaml file and prints them.\nIf you have trusted certificates, just use the second one (the one for the dashboard) and everything will be fine.\nIf you used the letsencrypt staging server, you will need to visit the first link first. Your browser will show a warning regarding untrusted certificates, you need to ignore that warning. You will then see a nearly blank page with some 404 message. After that, you can open the dashboard link, ignore the certificate warning again and should be able to login. If you skip the first link, you will still be able to see the dashboard, but the login button probably won\u0026rsquo;t work. While you will be able to login and create projects with the untrusted certificates from the letsencrypt staging server, creating secrets or shoots won\u0026rsquo;t be possible. You\u0026rsquo;ll need trusted certificates for that.\nTo log into the dashboard, use the options you have specified in the identity chart part of the landscape_config.yaml.\nTearing Down the Landscape Make sure that you delete all shoot clusters prior to tearing down the cluster. Not deleting project resources before deleting the Gardener can also cause troubles, because the namespaces associated with the projects have a finalizer which can\u0026rsquo;t be handled anymore when the Gardener is gone. Both, shoots and projects, can be deleted using the delete_all.sh script (give \u0026lsquo;shoots\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;projects\u0026rsquo; as an argument). To delete a single shoot/project, use this script.\nThe following command should not return any shoot clusters:\nkubectl get shoots --all-namespaces No resources found. If you created your base cluster with the Kubify component, you can destroy it using the undeploy command:\nundeploy kubify Cleanup After destroying the Kubify cluster, there will be some files left that prevent you from simply starting the project up again.\nATTENTION: Only do this if you are sure the cluster has been completely destroyed! Since this removes the terraform state, an automated deletion of resources won\u0026rsquo;t be possible anymore - you will have to clean up any leftovers manually.\n./cleanup.sh This will reset your landscape folder to its initial state (including the deletion of landscape.yaml).\nThe script takes an optional \u0026ldquo;-y\u0026rdquo; argument to skip the confirmation.\n"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/documentation/guides/landscape-setup/","title":"Landscape Setup","tags":[],"description":"","content":"\u0026mdash;DEPRECATED\u0026mdash; This project is outdated and won\u0026rsquo;t be updated anymore.

Do not proceed to the next step in case of errors.\nTL;DR If you are already familiar with the installation procedure and just want a short summary of the commands you have to use, here it is:\n# setup git clone --recursive https://github.com/gardener/landscape-setup-template.git landscape # fill in landscape/landscape_config.yaml now cd landscape/setup ./docker_run.sh deploy all # ------------------------------------------------------------------- # teardown undeploy all ./cleanup.sh Otherwise, follow the detailed guide below.\nKubectl Aliases The following aliases can be used within the docker container:\nk =\u0026gt; kubectl ks =\u0026gt; kubectl -n kube-system kg =\u0026gt; kubectl -n garden kn =\u0026gt; kubectl -n ka =\u0026gt; kubectl get --all-namespaces Bash completion works for all of them except for ka.\nStep 1: Clone the Repositories and get Dependencies Get the landscape-setup-template from GitHub and initialize the submodules:\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/gardener/landscape-setup-template.git landscape cd landscape After step 2, this repository will contain all passwords and keys for your landscape. You will be in trouble if you loose them so we recommend that you store this landscape configuration in a private repository. It might be a good idea to change the origin so you do not accidentally publish your secrets to the public template repository.\nSubmodule Management This project needs the Gardener and dashboard as submodules. To avoid conflicts between the checked out versions and the ones specified in the landscape_base.yaml file, automatic version management has been added. As long as the managed field in the chart area of each submodule is set to true, the version specified in the tag field will be checked out before deploying.\nTo check vor the correct version, the VERSION file in the submodule\u0026rsquo;s main folder is read and compared to the tag in the config file. If the VERSION file doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, the component is added as a submodule. If it exists, but the versions differ, the fitting version will be checked out. If it exists and the versions are identical, nothing is done. The automatic version management will fail if a) the component is already added as a submodule, but the VERSION file is missing or b) the landscape folder is not a git repo.\nIt is also possible to trigger the version update manually: call the manage_submodule function with gardener or dashboard as an argument, or run the manage_submodules.sh script which will update Gardener and dashboard. Both will only work from inside the docker container / with sourced init.sh file.\nStep 2: Configure the Landscape There is a landscape_config.yaml file in the landscape project. This is the only file that you need to modify - all other configuration files will be derived from this and the landscape_base.yaml file. The latter one contains the merging instructions as well as technical configurations and it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be touched unless you know what you are doing.\nBuilding the \u0026lsquo;landscape.yaml\u0026rsquo; File Both config files - landscape_config.yaml and landscape_base.yaml - are merged into one landscape.yaml file which is then used as configuration for the scripts. Sourcing the init.sh file (which happens automatically when entering the docker image) will perform this merge unless the file already exists. This means if you change something in one of the original config files after the landscape.yaml file has already been created, you need to manually rebuild it in order for the changes to take effect.\n./build_landscape_yaml.sh This script will recreate the landscape.yaml file. It will also source the init.sh file again, as some of the environment variables are extracted from this file.\nThe Base Cluster Gardener extends the Kubernetes apiserver, so in order to deploy it, you need a Kubernetes cluster first.

For missing parts the defaults will be used, which are the first and the last component of the active component order, respectively.\nThe undeploy command can also be used with the all component, but take care that the component order is inverted.\n# Examples # (start and end component are always inclusive) deploy all # deploys all components deploy all gardener:dashboard # deploys \u0026#39;gardener\u0026#39; through \u0026#39;dashboard\u0026#39; deploy all gardener: # deploys all components starting from \u0026#39;gardener\u0026#39; deploy all :gardener # deploys all components up to \u0026#39;gardener\u0026#39; # (all undeploy commands use the inverse component order) undeploy all # undeploys all components undeploy all :helm-tiller # undeploys all components up to \u0026#39;helm-tiller\u0026#39; undeploy all dashboard:cert # undeploys \u0026#39;dashboard\u0026#39; through \u0026#39;cert\u0026#39; Step 4-10: Deploying Components (detailed) Step 4: Kubify / etcd If you want to create a Kubify cluster, deploy the component:\ndeploy kubify The script will wait some time for the cluster to come up and then partly validate that the cluster is ready.\nIf you get errors during the cluster setup, just try to run the command again.\nOnce completed the following command should show all deployed pods:\nroot@c41327633d6d:/landscape# kubectl get pods --all-namespaces NAMESPACE NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE kube-system etcd-operator-75dcfcf4f7-xkm4h 1/1 Running 0 6m kube-system heapster-c8fb4f746-tvts6 2/2 Running 0 2m kube-system kube-apiserver-hcdnc 1/1 Running 0 6m [...]  If you already have a cluster, you don\u0026rsquo;t need Kubify. To deploy an etcd in your cluster, run\ndeploy etcd This component is not meant to be used in combination with Kubify and might require manual steps to make it work.\nIt should also be possible to plug in your own etcd - check the deploy scripts for the etcd and gardener components for information on where to put the certificates, etc.\nStep 5: Generate Certificates This step will generate a self-signed cluster CA and sign some certificates with it.\ndeploy cert Step 6: Deploy tiller Tiller is needed to deploy the Helm charts of Gardener and other components.\ndeploy helm-tiller Step 7: Deploy Gardener Now we can deploy Gardener. If the previous steps were executed successfully this should be completed in a couple of seconds.\ndeploy gardener You might see a couple of messages like these:\nGardener API server not yet reachable. Waiting... while the script waits for the Gardener to start. Once Gardener is up when the deployment script finished you can verify the correct setup by running the following command:\nkubectl get shoots No resources found. As we do not have a seed cluster yet we cannot create any shoot clusters. The Gardener itself is installed in the garden namespace:\nkubectl get po -n garden NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE gardener-apiserver-56cc665667-nvrjl 1/1 Running 0 6m gardener-controller-manager-5c9f8db55-hfcts 1/1 Running 0 6m Step 8: Register Garden Cluster as Seed Cluster In heterogeneous productive environments one would run Gardener and seed in separate clusters but for simplicity and resource consumption reasons we will register the Gardener cluster that we have just created also as the seed cluster. Make sure that the seed_config in the landscape file is correct and matches the region that you are using. Keep in mind that image ids differ between regions as well. Also, valid credentials for the seed provider have to be specified in the authentication part of the landscape_config.yaml file (the etcd backups of the shoot clusters are stored on the seed).\ndeploy seed-config Configuring Additional Seeds By default, this step will create a seed for the cloud provider the Gardener has been deployed on and thus creating shoots on this provider will be possible. If you want to create shoots on other cloud providers, you will have to configure additional seeds. There are two options for that:\nIf the seed-config deploy script is called without any arguments (as shown above), it will create seeds for all providers specified in the seed_config.seeds section in the landscape_config.yaml file. By default, the only entry in that list is the cloud provider chosen for the Gardener cluster, but you can extend the list.\nIt is also possible to provide the seed-config deploy script with additional arguments specifying which seeds should be created. Multiple arguments can be given and the script will ignore the list in the landscape_config.yaml file when called with arguments. Only the specified seeds will be created, already existing seeds are not affected. If a given seed already exists, it will be updated to the current configuration.\nIn both cases, the corresponding variant nodes in authentication and seed_config have to be filled out in the config file.\nValid values for seeds are aws, az (for Azure), gcp, and openstack. Please note, that while it is possible to create seeds for any cloud provider on any cloud provider, shoot creation may not work across cloud providers for every combination. It should always work if seed (Gardener cluster in this setup) and shoot are on the same provider, though.\nCreating a Shoot That\u0026rsquo;s it! If everything went fine you should now be able to create shoot clusters. You can start with a sample manifest and create a shoot cluster by standard Kubernetes means:\nkubectl apply -f shoot-aws.yaml Step 9: Install Identity and Dashboard Creating clusters based on a shoot manifest is quite nice but also a little complex. While almost all aspects of a shoot cluster can be configured, it can be quite difficult for beginners, so go on and install the dashboard:\ndeploy identity [...] deploy dashboard [...] Create CNAME Entry Dashboard and identity need a CNAME entry pointing the domain *.ingress.\u0026lt;your cluster domain\u0026gt; to your cluster\u0026rsquo;s nginx ingress ip/hostname. Kubify creates this entry automatically. If you are not using kubify to create your base cluster, you can create the CNAME entry with the corresponding component:\ndeploy cname The script uses the AWS CLI to create the entry, so it will only work for route53.\nStep 10: Apply Valid Certificates The following command will install the cert-manager and request valid letsencrypt certificates for both the identity and dashboard ingresses:\ndeploy certmanager After a few minutes valid certificates should be installed.\nLetsencrypt Quota Limits Letsencrypt limits how many certificates you can get for the same host within a short time. To avoid hitting these limits, you can use the letsencrypt staging server for testing, which has a significantly higher rate limit but produces untrusted certificates.\nThe charts.[certmanager].live field in the config file allows to switch between live and staging server (remember to rebuild the landscape.yaml file after you changed something in the landscape_config.yaml file).\nAccessing the Dashboard After step 9 you will be able to access the Gardener dashboard. There is a difference in how you access it depending on whether you used the letsencrypt live server or the staging one (and thus have untrusted credentials in the latter case).\nThe print_dashboard_urls.sh script constructs two URLs from the domain name given in the landscape.yaml file and prints them.\nIf you have trusted certificates, just use the second one (the one for the dashboard) and everything will be fine.\nIf you used the letsencrypt staging server, you will need to visit the first link first. Your browser will show a warning regarding untrusted certificates, you need to ignore that warning. You will then see a nearly blank page with some 404 message. After that, you can open the dashboard link, ignore the certificate warning again and should be able to login. If you skip the first link, you will still be able to see the dashboard, but the login button probably won\u0026rsquo;t work. While you will be able to login and create projects with the untrusted certificates from the letsencrypt staging server, creating secrets or shoots won\u0026rsquo;t be possible. You\u0026rsquo;ll need trusted certificates for that.\nTo log into the dashboard, use the options you have specified in the identity chart part of the landscape_config.yaml.\nTearing Down the Landscape Make sure that you delete all shoot clusters prior to tearing down the cluster. Not deleting project resources before deleting the Gardener can also cause troubles, because the namespaces associated with the projects have a finalizer which can\u0026rsquo;t be handled anymore when the Gardener is gone. Both, shoots and projects, can be deleted using the delete_all.sh script (give \u0026lsquo;shoots\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;projects\u0026rsquo; as an argument). To delete a single shoot/project, use this script.\nThe following command should not return any shoot clusters:\nkubectl get shoots --all-namespaces No resources found. If you created your base cluster with the Kubify component, you can destroy it using the undeploy command:\nundeploy kubify Cleanup After destroying the Kubify cluster, there will be some files left that prevent you from simply starting the project up again.\nATTENTION: Only do this if you are sure the cluster has been completely destroyed! Since this removes the terraform state, an automated deletion of resources won\u0026rsquo;t be possible anymore - you will have to clean up any leftovers manually.\n./cleanup.sh This will reset your landscape folder to its initial state (including the deletion of landscape.yaml).\nThe script takes an optional \u0026ldquo;-y\u0026rdquo; argument to skip the confirmation.\n"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/v1.12.8/guides/install_gardener/landscape-setup/","title":"Landscape Setup","tags":[],"description":"","content":"\u0026mdash;DEPRECATED\u0026mdash; This project is outdated and won\u0026rsquo;t be updated anymore.

A Linux machine (virtual machine is fine) or a Mac with basic tools such as a git client and the Docker runtime installed.  Gardener Installation Follow these steps to install Gardener. Do not proceed to the next step in case of errors.\nTL;DR If you are already familiar with the installation procedure and just want a short summary of the commands you have to use, here it is:\n# setup git clone --recursive https://github.com/gardener/landscape-setup-template.git landscape # fill in landscape/landscape_config.yaml now cd landscape/setup ./docker_run.sh deploy all # ------------------------------------------------------------------- # teardown undeploy all ./cleanup.sh Otherwise, follow the detailed guide below.\nKubectl Aliases The following aliases can be used within the docker container:\nk =\u0026gt; kubectl ks =\u0026gt; kubectl -n kube-system kg =\u0026gt; kubectl -n garden kn =\u0026gt; kubectl -n ka =\u0026gt; kubectl get --all-namespaces Bash completion works for all of them except for ka.\nStep 1: Clone the Repositories and get Dependencies Get the landscape-setup-template from GitHub and initialize the submodules:\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/gardener/landscape-setup-template.git landscape cd landscape After step 2, this repository will contain all passwords and keys for your landscape. You will be in trouble if you loose them so we recommend that you store this landscape configuration in a private repository. It might be a good idea to change the origin so you do not accidentally publish your secrets to the public template repository.\nSubmodule Management This project needs the Gardener and dashboard as submodules. To avoid conflicts between the checked out versions and the ones specified in the landscape_base.yaml file, automatic version management has been added. As long as the managed field in the chart area of each submodule is set to true, the version specified in the tag field will be checked out before deploying.\nTo check vor the correct version, the VERSION file in the submodule\u0026rsquo;s main folder is read and compared to the tag in the config file. If the VERSION file doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, the component is added as a submodule. If it exists, but the versions differ, the fitting version will be checked out. If it exists and the versions are identical, nothing is done. The automatic version management will fail if a) the component is already added as a submodule, but the VERSION file is missing or b) the landscape folder is not a git repo.\nIt is also possible to trigger the version update manually: call the manage_submodule function with gardener or dashboard as an argument, or run the manage_submodules.sh script which will update Gardener and dashboard. Both will only work from inside the docker container / with sourced init.sh file.\nStep 2: Configure the Landscape There is a landscape_config.yaml file in the landscape project. This is the only file that you need to modify - all other configuration files will be derived from this and the landscape_base.yaml file. The latter one contains the merging instructions as well as technical configurations and it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be touched unless you know what you are doing.\nBuilding the \u0026lsquo;landscape.yaml\u0026rsquo; File Both config files - landscape_config.yaml and landscape_base.yaml - are merged into one landscape.yaml file which is then used as configuration for the scripts. Sourcing the init.sh file (which happens automatically when entering the docker image) will perform this merge unless the file already exists. This means if you change something in one of the original config files after the landscape.yaml file has already been created, you need to manually rebuild it in order for the changes to take effect.\n./build_landscape_yaml.sh This script will recreate the landscape.yaml file. It will also source the init.sh file again, as some of the environment variables are extracted from this file.\nThe Base Cluster Gardener extends the Kubernetes apiserver, so in order to deploy it, you need a Kubernetes cluster first. This setup gives you two options for this:\nKubify You can use Kubify to create the initial cluster. Kubify uses Terraform to create the cluster and it is integrated into this project - you don\u0026rsquo;t need to create the cluster yourself, just make sure you fill out all relevant parts of the config file.\nShoot Cluster A shoot cluster is a cluster created by a Gardener instance and it can be used as a base cluster for this project. These flags have to be set for the kube-apiserver (if not set, the Gardener will still work, but the dashboard won\u0026rsquo;t):\n--oidc-issuer-url=https://identity.ingress.\u0026lt;yourclusterdomain\u0026gt;--oidc-client-id=kube-kubectl--oidc-username-claim=email--oidc-groups-claim=groupsFor a shoot this can be done by setting issuerUrl, clientID, usernameClaim, and groupsClaim in spec.kubernetes.kubeAPIServer.oidcConfig in the shoot manifest.\nAlso make sure that the CIDRs of your base cluster and the from your Gardener spawned shoots don\u0026rsquo;t overlap - if you want to be able to create shoots from the Gardener dashboard later, then don\u0026rsquo;t use the default CIDRs for this base cluster.\nSome fields in the landscape_config.yaml are marked with # kubify only, they can be ignored when using a shoot as the base cluster. The etcd server address defaults to the address for Kubify and needs to be changed for the shoot setup (see the comments in the config file).\nThe kubeconfig for the base cluster is expected to be named kubeconfig and reside in the directory containing this project\u0026rsquo;s directory (next to the landscape_config.yaml file).\nUsing an Arbitrary Base Cluster While this setup has only been tested for clusters created by Kubify or the Gardener (shoot clusters), it is theoretically possible to use the shoot setup method to deploy the Gardener to an arbitrary kubernetes cluster.\nStep 3: Build and Run Docker Container First, cd into the folder containing this project.\nThen run the container:\n./docker_run.sh After this,\n you will be connected to the container via an interactive shell the landscape folder will be mounted in that container your current working directory will be setup folder setup/init.sh is sourced, meaning  the environment variables will be set kubectl will be configured to communicate with your cluster landscape.yaml file will have been created if it didn\u0026rsquo;t exist before    The docker_run.sh script searches for the image locally and pulls it from an image repository, if it isn\u0026rsquo;t found. If pulling the image doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for whatever reason, you can use the docker_build.sh script to build the image locally.\nStep 4-10: Deploying Components The Gardener deployment is splitted into components. A single component can be easily deployed using\ndeploy \u0026lt;component name\u0026gt; Please take care that most of the components depend on each other and therefore have to be deployed in the order given below.\nThe deploy command is added to the PATH environment variable and can thus be called from anywhere. Bash auto-completion can be used for the component names.\nUndeploying Components It is also possible to \u0026ldquo;undeploy\u0026rdquo; a component using\nundeploy \u0026lt;component name\u0026gt; Components need to be undeployed in the inverse order. Do not undeploy components without undeploying their successors in the component order first. Take care to delete all shoots before undeploying the gardener or seed-config components (although both undeploy scripts will check for that and trigger a deletion themselves).\nThe \u0026lsquo;all\u0026rsquo; Component The all component is a special component: it serves as a dummy to deploy several components in one go. Usually, manual intervention between deploying components is not necessary and most of them are deployed directly one after the other, so the all component makes the \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; use-case easier.\nFor better control which components are deployed, a component range can be given as an argument. The argument should have the form \u0026lt;start component name\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;end component name\u0026gt; and then the start component, the end component, and all components in between will be deployed. The order of the arguments is taken from the environment variables with the $COMPONENT_ORDER_ prefix. The variable with the suffix that matches the clusters.base_cluster entry in the config file will be used.\nIt is also possible to drop one part of the range or to drop the whole argument. For missing parts the defaults will be used, which are the first and the last component of the active component order, respectively.\nThe undeploy command can also be used with the all component, but take care that the component order is inverted.\n# Examples # (start and end component are always inclusive) deploy all # deploys all components deploy all gardener:dashboard # deploys \u0026#39;gardener\u0026#39; through \u0026#39;dashboard\u0026#39; deploy all gardener: # deploys all components starting from \u0026#39;gardener\u0026#39; deploy all :gardener # deploys all components up to \u0026#39;gardener\u0026#39; # (all undeploy commands use the inverse component order) undeploy all # undeploys all components undeploy all :helm-tiller # undeploys all components up to \u0026#39;helm-tiller\u0026#39; undeploy all dashboard:cert # undeploys \u0026#39;dashboard\u0026#39; through \u0026#39;cert\u0026#39; Step 4-10: Deploying Components (detailed) Step 4: Kubify / etcd If you want to create a Kubify cluster, deploy the component:\ndeploy kubify The script will wait some time for the cluster to come up and then partly validate that the cluster is ready.\nIf you get errors during the cluster setup, just try to run the command again.\nOnce completed the following command should show all deployed pods:\nroot@c41327633d6d:/landscape# kubectl get pods --all-namespaces NAMESPACE NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE kube-system etcd-operator-75dcfcf4f7-xkm4h 1/1 Running 0 6m kube-system heapster-c8fb4f746-tvts6 2/2 Running 0 2m kube-system kube-apiserver-hcdnc 1/1 Running 0 6m [...]  If you already have a cluster, you don\u0026rsquo;t need Kubify. To deploy an etcd in your cluster, run\ndeploy etcd This component is not meant to be used in combination with Kubify and might require manual steps to make it work.\nIt should also be possible to plug in your own etcd - check the deploy scripts for the etcd and gardener components for information on where to put the certificates, etc.\nStep 5: Generate Certificates This step will generate a self-signed cluster CA and sign some certificates with it.\ndeploy cert Step 6: Deploy tiller Tiller is needed to deploy the Helm charts of Gardener and other components.\ndeploy helm-tiller Step 7: Deploy Gardener Now we can deploy Gardener. If the previous steps were executed successfully this should be completed in a couple of seconds.\ndeploy gardener You might see a couple of messages like these:\nGardener API server not yet reachable. Waiting... while the script waits for the Gardener to start. Once Gardener is up when the deployment script finished you can verify the correct setup by running the following command:\nkubectl get shoots No resources found. As we do not have a seed cluster yet we cannot create any shoot clusters. The Gardener itself is installed in the garden namespace:\nkubectl get po -n garden NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE gardener-apiserver-56cc665667-nvrjl 1/1 Running 0 6m gardener-controller-manager-5c9f8db55-hfcts 1/1 Running 0 6m Step 8: Register Garden Cluster as Seed Cluster In heterogeneous productive environments one would run Gardener and seed in separate clusters but for simplicity and resource consumption reasons we will register the Gardener cluster that we have just created also as the seed cluster. Make sure that the seed_config in the landscape file is correct and matches the region that you are using. Keep in mind that image ids differ between regions as well. Also, valid credentials for the seed provider have to be specified in the authentication part of the landscape_config.yaml file (the etcd backups of the shoot clusters are stored on the seed).\ndeploy seed-config Configuring Additional Seeds By default, this step will create a seed for the cloud provider the Gardener has been deployed on and thus creating shoots on this provider will be possible. If you want to create shoots on other cloud providers, you will have to configure additional seeds. There are two options for that:\nIf the seed-config deploy script is called without any arguments (as shown above), it will create seeds for all providers specified in the seed_config.seeds section in the landscape_config.yaml file. By default, the only entry in that list is the cloud provider chosen for the Gardener cluster, but you can extend the list.\nIt is also possible to provide the seed-config deploy script with additional arguments specifying which seeds should be created. Multiple arguments can be given and the script will ignore the list in the landscape_config.yaml file when called with arguments. Only the specified seeds will be created, already existing seeds are not affected. If a given seed already exists, it will be updated to the current configuration.\nIn both cases, the corresponding variant nodes in authentication and seed_config have to be filled out in the config file.\nValid values for seeds are aws, az (for Azure), gcp, and openstack. Please note, that while it is possible to create seeds for any cloud provider on any cloud provider, shoot creation may not work across cloud providers for every combination. It should always work if seed (Gardener cluster in this setup) and shoot are on the same provider, though.\nCreating a Shoot That\u0026rsquo;s it!

Do not proceed to the next step in case of errors.\nTL;DR If you are already familiar with the installation procedure and just want a short summary of the commands you have to use, here it is:\n# setup git clone --recursive https://github.com/gardener/landscape-setup-template.git landscape # fill in landscape/landscape_config.yaml now cd landscape/setup ./docker_run.sh deploy all # ------------------------------------------------------------------- # teardown undeploy all ./cleanup.sh Otherwise, follow the detailed guide below.\nKubectl Aliases The following aliases can be used within the docker container:\nk =\u0026gt; kubectl ks =\u0026gt; kubectl -n kube-system kg =\u0026gt; kubectl -n garden kn =\u0026gt; kubectl -n ka =\u0026gt; kubectl get --all-namespaces Bash completion works for all of them except for ka.\nStep 1: Clone the Repositories and get Dependencies Get the landscape-setup-template from GitHub and initialize the submodules:\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/gardener/landscape-setup-template.git landscape cd landscape After step 2, this repository will contain all passwords and keys for your landscape. You will be in trouble if you loose them so we recommend that you store this landscape configuration in a private repository. It might be a good idea to change the origin so you do not accidentally publish your secrets to the public template repository.\nSubmodule Management This project needs the Gardener and dashboard as submodules. To avoid conflicts between the checked out versions and the ones specified in the landscape_base.yaml file, automatic version management has been added. As long as the managed field in the chart area of each submodule is set to true, the version specified in the tag field will be checked out before deploying.\nTo check vor the correct version, the VERSION file in the submodule\u0026rsquo;s main folder is read and compared to the tag in the config file. If the VERSION file doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, the component is added as a submodule. If it exists, but the versions differ, the fitting version will be checked out. If it exists and the versions are identical, nothing is done. The automatic version management will fail if a) the component is already added as a submodule, but the VERSION file is missing or b) the landscape folder is not a git repo.\nIt is also possible to trigger the version update manually: call the manage_submodule function with gardener or dashboard as an argument, or run the manage_submodules.sh script which will update Gardener and dashboard. Both will only work from inside the docker container / with sourced init.sh file.\nStep 2: Configure the Landscape There is a landscape_config.yaml file in the landscape project. This is the only file that you need to modify - all other configuration files will be derived from this and the landscape_base.yaml file. The latter one contains the merging instructions as well as technical configurations and it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be touched unless you know what you are doing.\nBuilding the \u0026lsquo;landscape.yaml\u0026rsquo; File Both config files - landscape_config.yaml and landscape_base.yaml - are merged into one landscape.yaml file which is then used as configuration for the scripts. Sourcing the init.sh file (which happens automatically when entering the docker image) will perform this merge unless the file already exists. This means if you change something in one of the original config files after the landscape.yaml file has already been created, you need to manually rebuild it in order for the changes to take effect.\n./build_landscape_yaml.sh This script will recreate the landscape.yaml file. It will also source the init.sh file again, as some of the environment variables are extracted from this file.\nThe Base Cluster Gardener extends the Kubernetes apiserver, so in order to deploy it, you need a Kubernetes cluster first. This setup gives you two options for this:\nKubify You can use Kubify to create the initial cluster. Kubify uses Terraform to create the cluster and it is integrated into this project - you don\u0026rsquo;t need to create the cluster yourself, just make sure you fill out all relevant parts of the config file.\nShoot Cluster A shoot cluster is a cluster created by a Gardener instance and it can be used as a base cluster for this project. These flags have to be set for the kube-apiserver (if not set, the Gardener will still work, but the dashboard won\u0026rsquo;t):\n--oidc-issuer-url=https://identity.ingress.\u0026lt;yourclusterdomain\u0026gt;--oidc-client-id=kube-kubectl--oidc-username-claim=email--oidc-groups-claim=groupsFor a shoot this can be done by setting issuerUrl, clientID, usernameClaim, and groupsClaim in spec.kubernetes.kubeAPIServer.oidcConfig in the shoot manifest.\nAlso make sure that the CIDRs of your base cluster and the from your Gardener spawned shoots don\u0026rsquo;t overlap - if you want to be able to create shoots from the Gardener dashboard later, then don\u0026rsquo;t use the default CIDRs for this base cluster.\nSome fields in the landscape_config.yaml are marked with # kubify only, they can be ignored when using a shoot as the base cluster. The etcd server address defaults to the address for Kubify and needs to be changed for the shoot setup (see the comments in the config file).\nThe kubeconfig for the base cluster is expected to be named kubeconfig and reside in the directory containing this project\u0026rsquo;s directory (next to the landscape_config.yaml file).\nUsing an Arbitrary Base Cluster While this setup has only been tested for clusters created by Kubify or the Gardener (shoot clusters), it is theoretically possible to use the shoot setup method to deploy the Gardener to an arbitrary kubernetes cluster.\nStep 3: Build and Run Docker Container First, cd into the folder containing this project.\nThen run the container:\n./docker_run.sh After this,\n you will be connected to the container via an interactive shell the landscape folder will be mounted in that container your current working directory will be setup folder setup/init.sh is sourced, meaning  the environment variables will be set kubectl will be configured to communicate with your cluster landscape.yaml file will have been created if it didn\u0026rsquo;t exist before    The docker_run.sh script searches for the image locally and pulls it from an image repository, if it isn\u0026rsquo;t found. If pulling the image doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for whatever reason, you can use the docker_build.sh script to build the image locally.\nStep 4-10: Deploying Components The Gardener deployment is splitted into components. A single component can be easily deployed using\ndeploy \u0026lt;component name\u0026gt; Please take care that most of the components depend on each other and therefore have to be deployed in the order given below.\nThe deploy command is added to the PATH environment variable and can thus be called from anywhere. Bash auto-completion can be used for the component names.\nUndeploying Components It is also possible to \u0026ldquo;undeploy\u0026rdquo; a component using\nundeploy \u0026lt;component name\u0026gt; Components need to be undeployed in the inverse order. Do not undeploy components without undeploying their successors in the component order first. Take care to delete all shoots before undeploying the gardener or seed-config components (although both undeploy scripts will check for that and trigger a deletion themselves).\nThe \u0026lsquo;all\u0026rsquo; Component The all component is a special component: it serves as a dummy to deploy several components in one go. Usually, manual intervention between deploying components is not necessary and most of them are deployed directly one after the other, so the all component makes the \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; use-case easier.\nFor better control which components are deployed, a component range can be given as an argument. The argument should have the form \u0026lt;start component name\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;end component name\u0026gt; and then the start component, the end component, and all components in between will be deployed. The order of the arguments is taken from the environment variables with the $COMPONENT_ORDER_ prefix. The variable with the suffix that matches the clusters.base_cluster entry in the config file will be used.\nIt is also possible to drop one part of the range or to drop the whole argument. For missing parts the defaults will be used, which are the first and the last component of the active component order, respectively.\nThe undeploy command can also be used with the all component, but take care that the component order is inverted.\n# Examples # (start and end component are always inclusive) deploy all # deploys all components deploy all gardener:dashboard # deploys \u0026#39;gardener\u0026#39; through \u0026#39;dashboard\u0026#39; deploy all gardener: # deploys all components starting from \u0026#39;gardener\u0026#39; deploy all :gardener # deploys all components up to \u0026#39;gardener\u0026#39; # (all undeploy commands use the inverse component order) undeploy all # undeploys all components undeploy all :helm-tiller # undeploys all components up to \u0026#39;helm-tiller\u0026#39; undeploy all dashboard:cert # undeploys \u0026#39;dashboard\u0026#39; through \u0026#39;cert\u0026#39; Step 4-10: Deploying Components (detailed) Step 4: Kubify / etcd If you want to create a Kubify cluster, deploy the component:\ndeploy kubify The script will wait some time for the cluster to come up and then partly validate that the cluster is ready.\nIf you get errors during the cluster setup, just try to run the command again.\nOnce completed the following command should show all deployed pods:\nroot@c41327633d6d:/landscape# kubectl get pods --all-namespaces NAMESPACE NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE kube-system etcd-operator-75dcfcf4f7-xkm4h 1/1 Running 0 6m kube-system heapster-c8fb4f746-tvts6 2/2 Running 0 2m kube-system kube-apiserver-hcdnc 1/1 Running 0 6m [...]  If you already have a cluster, you don\u0026rsquo;t need Kubify. To deploy an etcd in your cluster, run\ndeploy etcd This component is not meant to be used in combination with Kubify and might require manual steps to make it work.\nIt should also be possible to plug in your own etcd - check the deploy scripts for the etcd and gardener components for information on where to put the certificates, etc.\nStep 5: Generate Certificates This step will generate a self-signed cluster CA and sign some certificates with it.\ndeploy cert Step 6: Deploy tiller Tiller is needed to deploy the Helm charts of Gardener and other components.\ndeploy helm-tiller Step 7: Deploy Gardener Now we can deploy Gardener. If the previous steps were executed successfully this should be completed in a couple of seconds.\ndeploy gardener You might see a couple of messages like these:\nGardener API server not yet reachable. Waiting... while the script waits for the Gardener to start. Once Gardener is up when the deployment script finished you can verify the correct setup by running the following command:\nkubectl get shoots No resources found. As we do not have a seed cluster yet we cannot create any shoot clusters. The Gardener itself is installed in the garden namespace:\nkubectl get po -n garden NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE gardener-apiserver-56cc665667-nvrjl 1/1 Running 0 6m gardener-controller-manager-5c9f8db55-hfcts 1/1 Running 0 6m Step 8: Register Garden Cluster as Seed Cluster In heterogeneous productive environments one would run Gardener and seed in separate clusters but for simplicity and resource consumption reasons we will register the Gardener cluster that we have just created also as the seed cluster. Make sure that the seed_config in the landscape file is correct and matches the region that you are using. Keep in mind that image ids differ between regions as well. Also, valid credentials for the seed provider have to be specified in the authentication part of the landscape_config.yaml file (the etcd backups of the shoot clusters are stored on the seed).\ndeploy seed-config Configuring Additional Seeds By default, this step will create a seed for the cloud provider the Gardener has been deployed on and thus creating shoots on this provider will be possible. If you want to create shoots on other cloud providers, you will have to configure additional seeds. There are two options for that:\nIf the seed-config deploy script is called without any arguments (as shown above), it will create seeds for all providers specified in the seed_config.seeds section in the landscape_config.yaml file. By default, the only entry in that list is the cloud provider chosen for the Gardener cluster, but you can extend the list.\nIt is also possible to provide the seed-config deploy script with additional arguments specifying which seeds should be created. Multiple arguments can be given and the script will ignore the list in the landscape_config.yaml file when called with arguments. Only the specified seeds will be created, already existing seeds are not affected. If a given seed already exists, it will be updated to the current configuration.\nIn both cases, the corresponding variant nodes in authentication and seed_config have to be filled out in the config file.\nValid values for seeds are aws, az (for Azure), gcp, and openstack. Please note, that while it is possible to create seeds for any cloud provider on any cloud provider, shoot creation may not work across cloud providers for every combination. It should always work if seed (Gardener cluster in this setup) and shoot are on the same provider, though.\nCreating a Shoot That\u0026rsquo;s it! If everything went fine you should now be able to create shoot clusters. You can start with a sample manifest and create a shoot cluster by standard Kubernetes means:\nkubectl apply -f shoot-aws.yaml Step 9: Install Identity and Dashboard Creating clusters based on a shoot manifest is quite nice but also a little complex. While almost all aspects of a shoot cluster can be configured, it can be quite difficult for beginners, so go on and install the dashboard:\ndeploy identity [...] deploy dashboard [...] Create CNAME Entry Dashboard and identity need a CNAME entry pointing the domain *.ingress.\u0026lt;your cluster domain\u0026gt; to your cluster\u0026rsquo;s nginx ingress ip/hostname. Kubify creates this entry automatically. If you are not using kubify to create your base cluster, you can create the CNAME entry with the corresponding component:\ndeploy cname The script uses the AWS CLI to create the entry, so it will only work for route53.\nStep 10: Apply Valid Certificates The following command will install the cert-manager and request valid letsencrypt certificates for both the identity and dashboard ingresses:\ndeploy certmanager After a few minutes valid certificates should be installed.\nLetsencrypt Quota Limits Letsencrypt limits how many certificates you can get for the same host within a short time. To avoid hitting these limits, you can use the letsencrypt staging server for testing, which has a significantly higher rate limit but produces untrusted certificates.\nThe charts.[certmanager].live field in the config file allows to switch between live and staging server (remember to rebuild the landscape.yaml file after you changed something in the landscape_config.yaml file).\nAccessing the Dashboard After step 9 you will be able to access the Gardener dashboard. There is a difference in how you access it depending on whether you used the letsencrypt live server or the staging one (and thus have untrusted credentials in the latter case).\nThe print_dashboard_urls.sh script constructs two URLs from the domain name given in the landscape.yaml file and prints them.\nIf you have trusted certificates, just use the second one (the one for the dashboard) and everything will be fine.\nIf you used the letsencrypt staging server, you will need to visit the first link first. Your browser will show a warning regarding untrusted certificates, you need to ignore that warning. You will then see a nearly blank page with some 404 message. After that, you can open the dashboard link, ignore the certificate warning again and should be able to login. If you skip the first link, you will still be able to see the dashboard, but the login button probably won\u0026rsquo;t work. While you will be able to login and create projects with the untrusted certificates from the letsencrypt staging server, creating secrets or shoots won\u0026rsquo;t be possible. You\u0026rsquo;ll need trusted certificates for that.\nTo log into the dashboard, use the options you have specified in the identity chart part of the landscape_config.yaml.\nTearing Down the Landscape Make sure that you delete all shoot clusters prior to tearing down the cluster. Not deleting project resources before deleting the Gardener can also cause troubles, because the namespaces associated with the projects have a finalizer which can\u0026rsquo;t be handled anymore when the Gardener is gone. Both, shoots and projects, can be deleted using the delete_all.sh script (give \u0026lsquo;shoots\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;projects\u0026rsquo; as an argument). To delete a single shoot/project, use this script.\nThe following command should not return any shoot clusters:\nkubectl get shoots --all-namespaces No resources found. If you created your base cluster with the Kubify component, you can destroy it using the undeploy command:\nundeploy kubify Cleanup After destroying the Kubify cluster, there will be some files left that prevent you from simply starting the project up again.\nATTENTION: Only do this if you are sure the cluster has been completely destroyed! Since this removes the terraform state, an automated deletion of resources won\u0026rsquo;t be possible anymore - you will have to clean up any leftovers manually.\n./cleanup.sh This will reset your landscape folder to its initial state (including the deletion of landscape.yaml).\nThe script takes an optional \u0026ldquo;-y\u0026rdquo; argument to skip the confirmation.\n"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/v1.13.2/guides/install_gardener/landscape-setup/","title":"Landscape Setup","tags":[],"description":"","content":"\u0026mdash;DEPRECATED\u0026mdash; This project is outdated and won\u0026rsquo;t be updated anymore.

The Gardener itself is installed in the garden namespace:\nkubectl get po -n garden NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE gardener-apiserver-56cc665667-nvrjl 1/1 Running 0 6m gardener-controller-manager-5c9f8db55-hfcts 1/1 Running 0 6m Step 8: Register Garden Cluster as Seed Cluster In heterogeneous productive environments one would run Gardener and seed in separate clusters but for simplicity and resource consumption reasons we will register the Gardener cluster that we have just created also as the seed cluster. Make sure that the seed_config in the landscape file is correct and matches the region that you are using. Keep in mind that image ids differ between regions as well. Also, valid credentials for the seed provider have to be specified in the authentication part of the landscape_config.yaml file (the etcd backups of the shoot clusters are stored on the seed).\ndeploy seed-config Configuring Additional Seeds By default, this step will create a seed for the cloud provider the Gardener has been deployed on and thus creating shoots on this provider will be possible. If you want to create shoots on other cloud providers, you will have to configure additional seeds. There are two options for that:\nIf the seed-config deploy script is called without any arguments (as shown above), it will create seeds for all providers specified in the seed_config.seeds section in the landscape_config.yaml file. By default, the only entry in that list is the cloud provider chosen for the Gardener cluster, but you can extend the list.\nIt is also possible to provide the seed-config deploy script with additional arguments specifying which seeds should be created. Multiple arguments can be given and the script will ignore the list in the landscape_config.yaml file when called with arguments. Only the specified seeds will be created, already existing seeds are not affected. If a given seed already exists, it will be updated to the current configuration.\nIn both cases, the corresponding variant nodes in authentication and seed_config have to be filled out in the config file.\nValid values for seeds are aws, az (for Azure), gcp, and openstack. Please note, that while it is possible to create seeds for any cloud provider on any cloud provider, shoot creation may not work across cloud providers for every combination. It should always work if seed (Gardener cluster in this setup) and shoot are on the same provider, though.\nCreating a Shoot That\u0026rsquo;s it! If everything went fine you should now be able to create shoot clusters. You can start with a sample manifest and create a shoot cluster by standard Kubernetes means:\nkubectl apply -f shoot-aws.yaml Step 9: Install Identity and Dashboard Creating clusters based on a shoot manifest is quite nice but also a little complex. While almost all aspects of a shoot cluster can be configured, it can be quite difficult for beginners, so go on and install the dashboard:\ndeploy identity [...] deploy dashboard [...] Create CNAME Entry Dashboard and identity need a CNAME entry pointing the domain *.ingress.\u0026lt;your cluster domain\u0026gt; to your cluster\u0026rsquo;s nginx ingress ip/hostname. Kubify creates this entry automatically. If you are not using kubify to create your base cluster, you can create the CNAME entry with the corresponding component:\ndeploy cname The script uses the AWS CLI to create the entry, so it will only work for route53.\nStep 10: Apply Valid Certificates The following command will install the cert-manager and request valid letsencrypt certificates for both the identity and dashboard ingresses:\ndeploy certmanager After a few minutes valid certificates should be installed.\nLetsencrypt Quota Limits Letsencrypt limits how many certificates you can get for the same host within a short time. To avoid hitting these limits, you can use the letsencrypt staging server for testing, which has a significantly higher rate limit but produces untrusted certificates.\nThe charts.[certmanager].live field in the config file allows to switch between live and staging server (remember to rebuild the landscape.yaml file after you changed something in the landscape_config.yaml file).\nAccessing the Dashboard After step 9 you will be able to access the Gardener dashboard. There is a difference in how you access it depending on whether you used the letsencrypt live server or the staging one (and thus have untrusted credentials in the latter case).\nThe print_dashboard_urls.sh script constructs two URLs from the domain name given in the landscape.yaml file and prints them.\nIf you have trusted certificates, just use the second one (the one for the dashboard) and everything will be fine.\nIf you used the letsencrypt staging server, you will need to visit the first link first. Your browser will show a warning regarding untrusted certificates, you need to ignore that warning. You will then see a nearly blank page with some 404 message. After that, you can open the dashboard link, ignore the certificate warning again and should be able to login. If you skip the first link, you will still be able to see the dashboard, but the login button probably won\u0026rsquo;t work. While you will be able to login and create projects with the untrusted certificates from the letsencrypt staging server, creating secrets or shoots won\u0026rsquo;t be possible. You\u0026rsquo;ll need trusted certificates for that.\nTo log into the dashboard, use the options you have specified in the identity chart part of the landscape_config.yaml.\nTearing Down the Landscape Make sure that you delete all shoot clusters prior to tearing down the cluster. Not deleting project resources before deleting the Gardener can also cause troubles, because the namespaces associated with the projects have a finalizer which can\u0026rsquo;t be handled anymore when the Gardener is gone. Both, shoots and projects, can be deleted using the delete_all.sh script (give \u0026lsquo;shoots\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;projects\u0026rsquo; as an argument). To delete a single shoot/project, use this script.\nThe following command should not return any shoot clusters:\nkubectl get shoots --all-namespaces No resources found. If you created your base cluster with the Kubify component, you can destroy it using the undeploy command:\nundeploy kubify Cleanup After destroying the Kubify cluster, there will be some files left that prevent you from simply starting the project up again.\nATTENTION: Only do this if you are sure the cluster has been completely destroyed! Since this removes the terraform state, an automated deletion of resources won\u0026rsquo;t be possible anymore - you will have to clean up any leftovers manually.\n./cleanup.sh This will reset your landscape folder to its initial state (including the deletion of landscape.yaml).\nThe script takes an optional \u0026ldquo;-y\u0026rdquo; argument to skip the confirmation.\n"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/v1.13.2/guides/landscape-setup/","title":"Landscape Setup","tags":[],"description":"","content":"\u0026mdash;DEPRECATED\u0026mdash; This project is outdated and won\u0026rsquo;t be updated anymore. Please use https://github.com/gardener/garden-setup instead!\nGardener Setup Scripts This README is the installation manual for a simple Gardener setup. The installation scripts in this repo are embedded in a configuration template in the landscape-setup-template project. You can find further information there.\nWe do recommend this simplified setup for demonstration purposes only. For productive workloads we do recommend that all components (Gardener/Seed/Shoot) run in their own IaaS accounts and that network policies are enabled and properly tested on the seed clusters. A documentation on how to do this is currently work in progress.\n Gardener Setup Scripts Prerequisites Gardener Installation  TL;DR  Kubectl Aliases   Step 1: Clone the Repositories and get Dependencies  Submodule Management   Step 2: Configure the Landscape  Building the \u0026lsquo;landscape.yaml\u0026rsquo; File The Base Cluster  Kubify Shoot Cluster Using an Arbitrary Base Cluster     Step 3: Build and Run Docker Container Step 4-10: Deploying Components  Undeploying Components The \u0026lsquo;all\u0026rsquo; Component   Step 4-10: Deploying Components (detailed)  Step 4: Kubify / etcd Step 5: Generate Certificates Step 6: Deploy tiller Step 7: Deploy Gardener Step 8: Register Garden Cluster as Seed Cluster  Configuring Additional Seeds Creating a Shoot   Step 9: Install Identity and Dashboard  Create CNAME Entry   Step 10: Apply Valid Certificates Letsencrypt Quota Limits  Accessing the Dashboard       Tearing Down the Landscape Cleanup  Prerequisites Before getting started make sure you have the following at hand:\n You need a cloud account with sufficient quota to set up a Kubernetes cluster with a couple of VMs. The Gardener supports AWS, Azure, GCP, and Openstack, but this simplified setup currently only supports AWS and Openstack. A Linux machine (virtual machine is fine) or a Mac with basic tools such as a git client and the Docker runtime installed.  Gardener Installation Follow these steps to install Gardener. Do not proceed to the next step in case of errors.\nTL;DR If you are already familiar with the installation procedure and just want a short summary of the commands you have to use, here it is:\n# setup git clone --recursive https://github.com/gardener/landscape-setup-template.git landscape # fill in landscape/landscape_config.yaml now cd landscape/setup ./docker_run.sh deploy all # ------------------------------------------------------------------- # teardown undeploy all ./cleanup.sh Otherwise, follow the detailed guide below.\nKubectl Aliases The following aliases can be used within the docker container:\nk =\u0026gt; kubectl ks =\u0026gt; kubectl -n kube-system kg =\u0026gt; kubectl -n garden kn =\u0026gt; kubectl -n ka =\u0026gt; kubectl get --all-namespaces Bash completion works for all of them except for ka.\nStep 1: Clone the Repositories and get Dependencies Get the landscape-setup-template from GitHub and initialize the submodules:\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/gardener/landscape-setup-template.git landscape cd landscape After step 2, this repository will contain all passwords and keys for your landscape. You will be in trouble if you loose them so we recommend that you store this landscape configuration in a private repository. It might be a good idea to change the origin so you do not accidentally publish your secrets to the public template repository.\nSubmodule Management This project needs the Gardener and dashboard as submodules. To avoid conflicts between the checked out versions and the ones specified in the landscape_base.yaml file, automatic version management has been added. As long as the managed field in the chart area of each submodule is set to true, the version specified in the tag field will be checked out before deploying.\nTo check vor the correct version, the VERSION file in the submodule\u0026rsquo;s main folder is read and compared to the tag in the config file. If the VERSION file doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, the component is added as a submodule. If it exists, but the versions differ, the fitting version will be checked out. If it exists and the versions are identical, nothing is done. The automatic version management will fail if a) the component is already added as a submodule, but the VERSION file is missing or b) the landscape folder is not a git repo.\nIt is also possible to trigger the version update manually: call the manage_submodule function with gardener or dashboard as an argument, or run the manage_submodules.sh script which will update Gardener and dashboard. Both will only work from inside the docker container / with sourced init.sh file.\nStep 2: Configure the Landscape There is a landscape_config.yaml file in the landscape project. This is the only file that you need to modify - all other configuration files will be derived from this and the landscape_base.yaml file. The latter one contains the merging instructions as well as technical configurations and it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be touched unless you know what you are doing.\nBuilding the \u0026lsquo;landscape.yaml\u0026rsquo; File Both config files - landscape_config.yaml and landscape_base.yaml - are merged into one landscape.yaml file which is then used as configuration for the scripts. Sourcing the init.sh file (which happens automatically when entering the docker image) will perform this merge unless the file already exists. This means if you change something in one of the original config files after the landscape.yaml file has already been created, you need to manually rebuild it in order for the changes to take effect.\n./build_landscape_yaml.sh This script will recreate the landscape.yaml file. It will also source the init.sh file again, as some of the environment variables are extracted from this file.\nThe Base Cluster Gardener extends the Kubernetes apiserver, so in order to deploy it, you need a Kubernetes cluster first. This setup gives you two options for this:\nKubify You can use Kubify to create the initial cluster. Kubify uses Terraform to create the cluster and it is integrated into this project - you don\u0026rsquo;t need to create the cluster yourself, just make sure you fill out all relevant parts of the config file.\nShoot Cluster A shoot cluster is a cluster created by a Gardener instance and it can be used as a base cluster for this project. These flags have to be set for the kube-apiserver (if not set, the Gardener will still work, but the dashboard won\u0026rsquo;t):\n--oidc-issuer-url=https://identity.ingress.\u0026lt;yourclusterdomain\u0026gt;--oidc-client-id=kube-kubectl--oidc-username-claim=email--oidc-groups-claim=groupsFor a shoot this can be done by setting issuerUrl, clientID, usernameClaim, and groupsClaim in spec.kubernetes.kubeAPIServer.oidcConfig in the shoot manifest.\nAlso make sure that the CIDRs of your base cluster and the from your Gardener spawned shoots don\u0026rsquo;t overlap - if you want to be able to create shoots from the Gardener dashboard later, then don\u0026rsquo;t use the default CIDRs for this base cluster.\nSome fields in the landscape_config.yaml are marked with # kubify only, they can be ignored when using a shoot as the base cluster. The etcd server address defaults to the address for Kubify and needs to be changed for the shoot setup (see the comments in the config file).\nThe kubeconfig for the base cluster is expected to be named kubeconfig and reside in the directory containing this project\u0026rsquo;s directory (next to the landscape_config.yaml file).\nUsing an Arbitrary Base Cluster While this setup has only been tested for clusters created by Kubify or the Gardener (shoot clusters), it is theoretically possible to use the shoot setup method to deploy the Gardener to an arbitrary kubernetes cluster.\nStep 3: Build and Run Docker Container First, cd into the folder containing this project.\nThen run the container:\n./docker_run.sh After this,\n you will be connected to the container via an interactive shell the landscape folder will be mounted in that container your current working directory will be setup folder setup/init.sh is sourced, meaning  the environment variables will be set kubectl will be configured to communicate with your cluster landscape.yaml file will have been created if it didn\u0026rsquo;t exist before    The docker_run.sh script searches for the image locally and pulls it from an image repository, if it isn\u0026rsquo;t found. If pulling the image doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for whatever reason, you can use the docker_build.sh script to build the image locally.\nStep 4-10: Deploying Components The Gardener deployment is splitted into components. A single component can be easily deployed using\ndeploy \u0026lt;component name\u0026gt; Please take care that most of the components depend on each other and therefore have to be deployed in the order given below.\nThe deploy command is added to the PATH environment variable and can thus be called from anywhere. Bash auto-completion can be used for the component names.\nUndeploying Components It is also possible to \u0026ldquo;undeploy\u0026rdquo; a component using\nundeploy \u0026lt;component name\u0026gt; Components need to be undeployed in the inverse order. Do not undeploy components without undeploying their successors in the component order first. Take care to delete all shoots before undeploying the gardener or seed-config components (although both undeploy scripts will check for that and trigger a deletion themselves).\nThe \u0026lsquo;all\u0026rsquo; Component The all component is a special component: it serves as a dummy to deploy several components in one go. Usually, manual intervention between deploying components is not necessary and most of them are deployed directly one after the other, so the all component makes the \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; use-case easier.\nFor better control which components are deployed, a component range can be given as an argument. The argument should have the form \u0026lt;start component name\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;end component name\u0026gt; and then the start component, the end component, and all components in between will be deployed. The order of the arguments is taken from the environment variables with the $COMPONENT_ORDER_ prefix. The variable with the suffix that matches the clusters.base_cluster entry in the config file will be used.\nIt is also possible to drop one part of the range or to drop the whole argument. For missing parts the defaults will be used, which are the first and the last component of the active component order, respectively.\nThe undeploy command can also be used with the all component, but take care that the component order is inverted.\n# Examples # (start and end component are always inclusive) deploy all # deploys all components deploy all gardener:dashboard # deploys \u0026#39;gardener\u0026#39; through \u0026#39;dashboard\u0026#39; deploy all gardener: # deploys all components starting from \u0026#39;gardener\u0026#39; deploy all :gardener # deploys all components up to \u0026#39;gardener\u0026#39; # (all undeploy commands use the inverse component order) undeploy all # undeploys all components undeploy all :helm-tiller # undeploys all components up to \u0026#39;helm-tiller\u0026#39; undeploy all dashboard:cert # undeploys \u0026#39;dashboard\u0026#39; through \u0026#39;cert\u0026#39; Step 4-10: Deploying Components (detailed) Step 4: Kubify / etcd If you want to create a Kubify cluster, deploy the component:\ndeploy kubify The script will wait some time for the cluster to come up and then partly validate that the cluster is ready.\nIf you get errors during the cluster setup, just try to run the command again.\nOnce completed the following command should show all deployed pods:\nroot@c41327633d6d:/landscape# kubectl get pods --all-namespaces NAMESPACE NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE kube-system etcd-operator-75dcfcf4f7-xkm4h 1/1 Running 0 6m kube-system heapster-c8fb4f746-tvts6 2/2 Running 0 2m kube-system kube-apiserver-hcdnc 1/1 Running 0 6m [...]  If you already have a cluster, you don\u0026rsquo;t need Kubify. To deploy an etcd in your cluster, run\ndeploy etcd This component is not meant to be used in combination with Kubify and might require manual steps to make it work.\nIt should also be possible to plug in your own etcd - check the deploy scripts for the etcd and gardener components for information on where to put the certificates, etc.\nStep 5: Generate Certificates This step will generate a self-signed cluster CA and sign some certificates with it.\ndeploy cert Step 6: Deploy tiller Tiller is needed to deploy the Helm charts of Gardener and other components.\ndeploy helm-tiller Step 7: Deploy Gardener Now we can deploy Gardener. If the previous steps were executed successfully this should be completed in a couple of seconds.\ndeploy gardener You might see a couple of messages like these:\nGardener API server not yet reachable. Waiting... while the script waits for the Gardener to start. Once Gardener is up when the deployment script finished you can verify the correct setup by running the following command:\nkubectl get shoots No resources found. As we do not have a seed cluster yet we cannot create any shoot clusters. The Gardener itself is installed in the garden namespace:\nkubectl get po -n garden NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE gardener-apiserver-56cc665667-nvrjl 1/1 Running 0 6m gardener-controller-manager-5c9f8db55-hfcts 1/1 Running 0 6m Step 8: Register Garden Cluster as Seed Cluster In heterogeneous productive environments one would run Gardener and seed in separate clusters but for simplicity and resource consumption reasons we will register the Gardener cluster that we have just created also as the seed cluster. Make sure that the seed_config in the landscape file is correct and matches the region that you are using. Keep in mind that image ids differ between regions as well. Also, valid credentials for the seed provider have to be specified in the authentication part of the landscape_config.yaml file (the etcd backups of the shoot clusters are stored on the seed).\ndeploy seed-config Configuring Additional Seeds By default, this step will create a seed for the cloud provider the Gardener has been deployed on and thus creating shoots on this provider will be possible. If you want to create shoots on other cloud providers, you will have to configure additional seeds. There are two options for that:\nIf the seed-config deploy script is called without any arguments (as shown above), it will create seeds for all providers specified in the seed_config.seeds section in the landscape_config.yaml file. By default, the only entry in that list is the cloud provider chosen for the Gardener cluster, but you can extend the list.\nIt is also possible to provide the seed-config deploy script with additional arguments specifying which seeds should be created. Multiple arguments can be given and the script will ignore the list in the landscape_config.yaml file when called with arguments. Only the specified seeds will be created, already existing seeds are not affected. If a given seed already exists, it will be updated to the current configuration.\nIn both cases, the corresponding variant nodes in authentication and seed_config have to be filled out in the config file.\nValid values for seeds are aws, az (for Azure), gcp, and openstack. Please note, that while it is possible to create seeds for any cloud provider on any cloud provider, shoot creation may not work across cloud providers for every combination. It should always work if seed (Gardener cluster in this setup) and shoot are on the same provider, though.\nCreating a Shoot That\u0026rsquo;s it! If everything went fine you should now be able to create shoot clusters. You can start with a sample manifest and create a shoot cluster by standard Kubernetes means:\nkubectl apply -f shoot-aws.yaml Step 9: Install Identity and Dashboard Creating clusters based on a shoot manifest is quite nice but also a little complex.

While you will be able to login and create projects with the untrusted certificates from the letsencrypt staging server, creating secrets or shoots won\u0026rsquo;t be possible. You\u0026rsquo;ll need trusted certificates for that.\nTo log into the dashboard, use the options you have specified in the identity chart part of the landscape_config.yaml.\nTearing Down the Landscape Make sure that you delete all shoot clusters prior to tearing down the cluster. Not deleting project resources before deleting the Gardener can also cause troubles, because the namespaces associated with the projects have a finalizer which can\u0026rsquo;t be handled anymore when the Gardener is gone. Both, shoots and projects, can be deleted using the delete_all.sh script (give \u0026lsquo;shoots\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;projects\u0026rsquo; as an argument). To delete a single shoot/project, use this script.\nThe following command should not return any shoot clusters:\nkubectl get shoots --all-namespaces No resources found. If you created your base cluster with the Kubify component, you can destroy it using the undeploy command:\nundeploy kubify Cleanup After destroying the Kubify cluster, there will be some files left that prevent you from simply starting the project up again.\nATTENTION: Only do this if you are sure the cluster has been completely destroyed!

For further information how to make use of it in these roles, refer to the corresponding guides for exploring logs and for monitoring with Grafana.\nThe components that constitute the logging and monitoring stack are managed by Gardener. By default, it deploys Prometheus, Alertmanager and Grafana into the garden namespace of all seed clusters. If the Logging feature gate in the gardenlet configuration is enabled, it will deploy fluent-bit and Loki in the garden namespace too.\nEach shoot namespace hosts managed logging and monitoring components. As part of the shoot reconciliation flow, Gardener deploys a shoot-specific Prometheus, Grafana and, if configured, an Alertmanager into the shoot namespace, next to the other control plane components. If the Logging feature gate is enabled and the shoot purpose is not testing, it deploys a shoot-specific Loki in the shoot namespace too.\nThe logging and monitoring stack is extensible by configuration. Gardener extensions can take advantage of that and contribute configurations encoded in ConfigMaps for their own, specific dashboards, alerts, log parsers and other supported assets and integrate with it. As with other Gardener resources, they will be continuously reconciled.\nThis guide is about the roles and extensibility options of the logging and monitoring stack components, and how to integrate extensions with:\n Monitoring Logging  Monitoring The central Prometheus instance in the garden namespace fetches metrics and data from all seed cluster nodes and all seed cluster pods. It uses the federation concept to allow the shoot-specific instances to scrape only the metrics for the pods of the control plane they are responsible for. This mechanism allows to scrape the metrics for the nodes/pods once for the whole cluster, and to have them distributed afterwards.\nThe shoot-specific metrics are then made available to operators and users in the shoot Grafana, using the shoot Prometheus as data source.\nExtension controllers might deploy components as part of their reconciliation next to the shoot\u0026rsquo;s control plane. Examples for this would be a cloud-controller-manager or CSI controller deployments. Extensions that want to have their managed control plane components integrated with monitoring can contribute their per-shoot configuration for scraping Prometheus metrics, Alertmanager alerts or Grafana dashboards.\nExtensions monitoring integration Before deploying the shoot-specific Prometheus instance, Gardener will read all ConfigMaps in the shoot namespace, which are labeled with extensions.gardener.cloud/configuration=monitoring. Such ConfigMaps may contain four fields in their data:\n scrape_config: This field contains Prometheus scrape configuration for the component(s) and metrics that shall be scraped. alerting_rules: This field contains Alertmanager rules for alerts that shall be raised. dashboard_operators: This field contains a Grafana dashboard in JSON that is only relevant for Gardener operators. dashboard_users: This field contains a Grafana dashboard in JSON that is only relevant for Gardener users (shoot owners).  Example: A ControlPlane controller deploying a cloud-controller-manager into the shoot namespace wants to integrate monitoring configuration for scraping metrics, alerting rules and dashboards.\napiVersion:v1kind:ConfigMapmetadata:name:extension-controlplane-monitoring-ccmnamespace:shoot--project--namelabels:extensions.gardener.cloud/configuration:monitoringdata:scrape_config:| - job_name: cloud-controller-managerscheme:httpstls_config:insecure_skip_verify:truecert_file:/etc/prometheus/seed/prometheus.crtkey_file:/etc/prometheus/seed/prometheus.keyhonor_labels:falsekubernetes_sd_configs:- role:endpointsnamespaces:names:[shoot--project--name]relabel_configs:- source_labels:- __meta_kubernetes_service_name- __meta_kubernetes_endpoint_port_nameaction:keepregex:cloud-controller-manager;metrics# common metrics- action:labelmapregex:__meta_kubernetes_service_label_(.+)- source_labels:[__meta_kubernetes_pod_name]target_label:podmetric_relabel_configs:- process_max_fds- process_open_fdsalerting_rules:| cloud-controller-manager.rules.yaml: |groups:- name:cloud-controller-manager.rulesrules:- alert:CloudControllerManagerDownexpr:absent(up{job=\u0026#34;cloud-controller-manager\u0026#34;}==1)for:15mlabels:service:cloud-controller-managerseverity:criticaltype:seedvisibility:allannotations:description:Allinfrastructurespecificoperationscannotbecompleted(e.g.creatingloadbalancersorpersistentvolumes).summary:Cloudcontrollermanagerisdown.dashboard_operators:\u0026lt;some-json-describing-a-grafana-dashboard-for-operators\u0026gt; dashboard_users:\u0026lt;some-json-describing-a-grafana-dashboard-for-users\u0026gt;Logging In Kubernetes clusters, container logs are non-persistent and do not survive stopped and destroyed containers. Gardener addresses this problem for the components hosted in a seed cluster, by introducing its own managed logging solution. It is integrated with the Gardener monitoring stack to have all troubleshooting context in one place.\nGardener logging consists of components in three roles - log collectors and forwarders, log persistency and exploration/consumption interfaces. All of them live in the seed clusters in multiple instances:\n Logs are persisted by Loki instances deployed as StatefulSets - one per shoot namespace, if the Logging feature gate is enabled and the shoot purpose is not testing, and one in the garden namespace. The shoot instances store logs from the control plane components hosted there. The garden Loki instance is responsible for logs from the rest of the seed namespaces - kube-system, garden extension-* and others. Fluent-bit DaemonSets deployed on each seed node collect logs from it. A custom plugin takes care to distribute the collected log messages to the Loki instances that they are intended for. This allows to fetch the logs once for the whole cluster, and to distribute them afterwards. Grafana is the UI component used to explore monitoring and log data together for easier troubleshooting and in context. Grafana instances are configured to use the coresponding Loki instances, sharing the same namespace, as data providers. There is one Grafana Deployment in the garden namespace and two Deployments per shoot namespace (one exposed to the end users and one for the operators).  Logs can be produced from various sources, such as containers or systemd, and in different formats. The fluent-bit design supports configurable data pipeline to address that problem. Gardener provides such configuration for logs produced by all its core managed components as a ConfigMap. Extensions can contribute their own, specific configurations as ConfigMaps too. See for example the logging configuration for the Gardener AWS provider extension. The Gardener reconciliation loop watches such resources and updates the fluent-bit agents dynamically.\nExtensions logging integration Fluent-bit log parsers and filters To integrate with Gardener logging, extensions can and should specify how fluent-bit will handle the logs produced by the managed components that they contribute to Gardener. Normally, that would require to configure a parser for the specific logging format, if none of the available is applicable, and a filter defining how to apply it. For a complete reference for the configuration options, refer to fluent-bit\u0026rsquo;s documentation.\nNote: At the moment only parser and filter configurations are supported.\nTo contribute its own configuration to the fluent-bit agents data pipelines, an extension must provide it as a ConfigMap labeled extensions.gardener.cloud/configuration=logging and deployed in the seed\u0026rsquo;s garden namespace. Unlike the monitoring stack, where configurations are deployed per shoot, here a single configuration ConfigMap is sufficient and it applies to all fluent-bit agents in the seed. Its data field can have the following properties:\n filter-kubernetes.conf - configuration for data pipeline filters parser.conf - configuration for data pipeline parsers  Note: Take care to provide the correct data pipeline elements in the coresponding data field and not to mix them.\nExample: Logging configuration for provider-specific (OpenStack) worker controller deploying a machine-controller-manager component into a shoot namespace that reuses the kubeapiserverParser defined in fluent-bit-configmap.yaml to parse the component logs\napiVersion:v1kind:ConfigMapmetadata:name:gardener-extension-provider-openstack-logging-confignamespace:gardenlabels:extensions.gardener.cloud/configuration:loggingdata:filter-kubernetes.conf:| [FILTER]NameparserMatchkubernetes.machine-controller-manager*openstack-machine-controller-manager*Key_NamelogParserkubeapiserverParserReserve_DataTrueFurther details how to define parsers and use them with examples can be found in the following guide.\nGrafana The three types of Grafana instances found in a seed cluster are configured to expose logs of different origin in their dashboards:\n Garden Grafana dashboards expose logs from non-shoot namespaces of the seed clusters  Pod Logs Extensions Systemd Logs   Shoot User Grafana dashboards expose a subset of the logs shown to operators  Kube Apiserver Kube Controller Manager Kube Scheduler Cluster Autoscaler   Shoot Operator Grafana dashboards expose logs from the shoot cluster namespace where they belong  All user\u0026rsquo;s dashboards Kubernetes Pods    If the type of logs exposed in the Grafana instances needs to be changed, it is necessary to update the coresponding instance dashboard configurations.\nTips  Be careful to match exactly the log names that you need for a particular parser in your filters configuration. The regular expression you will supply will match names in the form kubernetes.pod_name.\u0026lt;metadata\u0026gt;.container_name. If there are extensions with the same container and pod names, they will all match the same parser in a filter. That may be a desired effect, if they all share the same log format. But it will be a problem if they don\u0026rsquo;t. To solve it, either the pod or container names must be unique, and the regular expression in the filter has to match that unique pattern. A recommended approach is to prefix containers with the extension name and tune the regular expression to match it. For example, using myextension-container as container name, and a regular expression kubernetes.mypod.*myextension-container will guarantee match of the right log name. Make sure that the regular expression does not match more than you expect. For example, kubernetes.systemd.*systemd.* will match both systemd-service and systemd-monitor-service. You will want to be as specific as possible. It\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to put the logging configuration into the Helm chart that also deploys the extension controller, while the monitoring configuration can be part of the Helm chart/deployment routine that deploys the component managed by the controller.

For further information how to make use of it in these roles, refer to the corresponding guides for exploring logs and for monitoring with Grafana.\nThe components that constitute the logging and monitoring stack are managed by Gardener. By default, it deploys Prometheus, Alertmanager and Grafana into the garden namespace of all seed clusters. If the Logging feature gate in the gardenlet configuration is enabled, it will deploy fluent-bit and Loki in the garden namespace too.\nEach shoot namespace hosts managed logging and monitoring components. As part of the shoot reconciliation flow, Gardener deploys a shoot-specific Prometheus, Grafana and, if configured, an Alertmanager into the shoot namespace, next to the other control plane components.

Gardener extensions can take advantage of that and contribute configurations encoded in ConfigMaps for their own, specific dashboards, alerts, log parsers and other supported assets and integrate with it. As with other Gardener resources, they will be continuously reconciled.\nThis guide is about the roles and extensibility options of the logging and monitoring stack components, and how to integrate extensions with:\n Monitoring Logging  Monitoring The central Prometheus instance in the garden namespace fetches metrics and data from all seed cluster nodes and all seed cluster pods. It uses the federation concept to allow the shoot-specific instances to scrape only the metrics for the pods of the control plane they are responsible for. This mechanism allows to scrape the metrics for the nodes/pods once for the whole cluster, and to have them distributed afterwards.\nThe shoot-specific metrics are then made available to operators and users in the shoot Grafana, using the shoot Prometheus as data source.\nExtension controllers might deploy components as part of their reconciliation next to the shoot\u0026rsquo;s control plane. Examples for this would be a cloud-controller-manager or CSI controller deployments. Extensions that want to have their managed control plane components integrated with monitoring can contribute their per-shoot configuration for scraping Prometheus metrics, Alertmanager alerts or Grafana dashboards.\nExtensions monitoring integration Before deploying the shoot-specific Prometheus instance, Gardener will read all ConfigMaps in the shoot namespace, which are labeled with extensions.gardener.cloud/configuration=monitoring. Such ConfigMaps may contain four fields in their data:\n scrape_config: This field contains Prometheus scrape configuration for the component(s) and metrics that shall be scraped. alerting_rules: This field contains Alertmanager rules for alerts that shall be raised. dashboard_operators: This field contains a Grafana dashboard in JSON that is only relevant for Gardener operators. dashboard_users: This field contains a Grafana dashboard in JSON that is only relevant for Gardener users (shoot owners).

Gardener addresses this problem for the components hosted in a seed cluster, by introducing its own managed logging solution. It is integrated with the Gardener monitoring stack to have all troubleshooting context in one place.\nGardener logging consists of components in three roles - log collectors and forwarders, log persistency and exploration/consumption interfaces. All of them live in the seed clusters in multiple instances:\n Logs are persisted by Loki instances deployed as StatefulSets - one per shoot namespace, if the Logging feature gate is enabled and the shoot purpose is not testing, and one in the garden namespace. The shoot instances store logs from the control plane components hosted there. The garden Loki instance is responsible for logs from the rest of the seed namespaces - kube-system, garden extension-* and others. Fluent-bit DaemonSets deployed on each seed node collect logs from it. A custom plugin takes care to distribute the collected log messages to the Loki instances that they are intended for. This allows to fetch the logs once for the whole cluster, and to distribute them afterwards. Grafana is the UI component used to explore monitoring and log data together for easier troubleshooting and in context. Grafana instances are configured to use the coresponding Loki instances, sharing the same namespace, as data providers. There is one Grafana Deployment in the garden namespace and two Deployments per shoot namespace (one exposed to the end users and one for the operators).  Logs can be produced from various sources, such as containers or systemd, and in different formats. The fluent-bit design supports configurable data pipeline to address that problem. Gardener provides such configuration for logs produced by all its core managed components as a ConfigMap. Extensions can contribute their own, specific configurations as ConfigMaps too. See for example the logging configuration for the Gardener AWS provider extension. The Gardener reconciliation loop watches such resources and updates the fluent-bit agents dynamically.\nExtensions logging integration Fluent-bit log parsers and filters To integrate with Gardener logging, extensions can and should specify how fluent-bit will handle the logs produced by the managed components that they contribute to Gardener.

Gardener installs a few components onto every worker machine in order to allow it to join the shoot cluster.

Usually, you would submit all the components you want to install onto the machine as part of the user-data during creation time.

That\u0026rsquo;s why we do not send the \u0026ldquo;original\u0026rdquo; user-data to the machine-controller-manager (who forwards it then to the provider\u0026rsquo;s API).

With ongoing development and new releases of Gardener some new components could be required to get installed onto every shoot worker VM, or existing components need to be changed. Gardener achieves that by simply updating the user-data inside the Secrets mentioned above (step 1). The downloader script is continuously (every 30s) reading the secret\u0026rsquo;s content (which might include an updated user-data) and storing it onto the disk. In order to re-apply the (new) downloaded data the secrets do not only contain the \u0026ldquo;original\u0026rdquo; user-data but also another short script (called \u0026ldquo;execution\u0026rdquo; script). This script checks whether the downloaded user-data differs from the one previously applied - and if required - re-applies it. After that it uses systemctl to restart the installed systemd units.\nWith the help of the execution script Gardener can centrally control how machines are updated without the need of OS providers to (re-)implement that logic. However, as stated in the mentioned requirements above, the execution script assumes existence of Docker and systemd.\nWhat needs to be implemented to support a new operating system? As part of the shoot flow Gardener will create a special CRD in the seed cluster that needs to be reconciled by an extension controller, for example:\n---apiVersion:extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:OperatingSystemConfigmetadata:name:pool-01-originalnamespace:defaultspec:type:\u0026lt;my-operating-system\u0026gt; purpose: reconcilereloadConfigFilePath:/var/lib/cloud-config-downloader/cloud-configunits:- name:docker.servicedropIns:- name:10-docker-opts.confcontent:| [Service]Environment=\u0026#34;DOCKER_OPTS=--log-opt max-size=60m --log-opt max-file=3\u0026#34;- name:docker-monitor.servicecommand:startenable:truecontent:| [Unit]Description=Docker-monitordaemonAfter=kubelet.service[Install]WantedBy=multi-user.target[Service]Restart=alwaysEnvironmentFile=/etc/environmentExecStart=/opt/bin/health-monitordockerfiles:- path:/var/lib/kubelet/ca.crtpermissions:0644encoding:b64content:secretRef:name:default-token-5dtjzdataKey:token- path:/etc/sysctl.d/99-k8s-general.confpermissions:0644content:inline:data:| # A higher vm.max_map_count is great for elasticsearch, mongo, or other mmap users# See https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/1340vm.max_map_count=135217728In order to support a new operating system you need to write a controller that watches all OperatingSystemConfigs with .spec.type=\u0026lt;my-operating-system\u0026gt;. For those it shall generate a configuration blob that fits to your operating system. For example, a CoreOS controller might generate a CoreOS cloud-config or Ignition, SLES might generate cloud-init, and others might simply generate a bash script translating the .spec.units into systemd units, and .spec.files into real files on the disk.\nOperatingSystemConfigs can have two purposes which can be used (or ignored) by the extension controllers: either provision or reconcile.\n The provision purpose is used by Gardener for the user-data that it later passes to the machine-controller-manager (and then to the provider\u0026rsquo;s API) when creating new VMs. It contains the downloader unit. The reconcile purpose contains the \u0026ldquo;original\u0026rdquo; user-data (that is then stored in Secrets in the shoot\u0026rsquo;s kube-system namespace (see step 1). This is downloaded and applies late (see step 5).  As described above, the \u0026ldquo;original\u0026rdquo; user-data must be re-applicable to allow in-place updates. The way how this is done is specific to the generated operating system config (e.g., for CoreOS cloud-init the command is /usr/bin/coreos-cloudinit --from-file=\u0026lt;path\u0026gt;, whereas SLES would run cloud-init --file \u0026lt;path\u0026gt; single -n write_files --frequency=once). Consequently, besides the generated OS config, the extension controller must also provide a command for re-application an updated version of the user-data. As visible in the mentioned examples the command requires a path to the user-data file. Gardener will provide the path to the file in the OperatingSystemConfigs .spec.reloadConfigFilePath field (only if .spec.purpose=reconcile). As soon as Gardener detects that the user data has changed it will reload the systemd daemon and restart all the units provided in the .status.units[] list (see below example). The same logic applies during the very first application of the whole configuration.\nAfter generation extension controllers are asked to store their OS config inside a Secret (as it might contain confidential data) in the same namespace.

Gardener will provide the path to the file in the OperatingSystemConfigs .spec.reloadConfigFilePath field (only if .spec.purpose=reconcile). As soon as Gardener detects that the user data has changed it will reload the systemd daemon and restart all the units provided in the .status.units[] list (see below example). The same logic applies during the very first application of the whole configuration.\nAfter generation extension controllers are asked to store their OS config inside a Secret (as it might contain confidential data) in the same namespace. The secret\u0026rsquo;s .data could look like this:\napiVersion:v1kind:Secretmetadata:name:osc-result-pool-01-originalnamespace:defaultownerReferences:- apiVersion:extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1blockOwnerDeletion:truecontroller:truekind:OperatingSystemConfigname:pool-01-originaluid:99c0c5ca-19b9-11e9-9ebd-d67077b40f82data:cloud_config:base64(generated-user-data)Finally, the secret\u0026rsquo;s metadata, the OS-specific command to re-apply the configuration, and the list of systemd units that shall be considered to be restarted if an updated version of the user-data is re-applied must be provided in the OperatingSystemConfig's .status field:\n...status:cloudConfig:secretRef:name:osc-result-pool-01-originalnamespace:defaultcommand:/usr/bin/coreos-cloudinit--from-file=/var/lib/cloud-config-downloader/cloud-configlastOperation:description:SuccessfullygeneratedcloudconfiglastUpdateTime:\u0026#34;2019-01-23T07:45:23Z\u0026#34;progress:100state:Succeededtype:ReconcileobservedGeneration:5units:- docker-monitor.service(The .status.command field is optional and must only be provided if .spec.reloadConfigFilePath exists).\nOnce the .status indicates that the extension controller finished reconciling Gardener will continue with the next step of the shoot reconciliation flow.\nCRI Support Gardener supports specifying Container Runtime Interface (CRI) configuration in the OperatingSystemConfig resource. The only CRI supported at the moment is: \u0026ldquo;containerd\u0026rdquo;. For example:\n---apiVersion:extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:OperatingSystemConfigmetadata:name:pool-01-originalnamespace:defaultspec:type:\u0026lt;my-operating-system\u0026gt; purpose: reconcilereloadConfigFilePath:/var/lib/cloud-config-downloader/cloud-configcri:name:containerd...If the .spec.cri section exists then the name property is mandatory. The only valid value at the moment is containerd. When the .spec.cri field is declared the kubelet will be configured by Gardener to work with ContainerD. Gardener expects that ContainerD service is running on the OS with the default socket path: unix:///run/containerd/containerd.sock.\nEach OS extension must support the CRI configurations by:\n The operating system must have built-in ContainerD and the Client CLI ContainerD service should be configure to work with the default configuration file in: /etc/containerd.config.toml (Created by Gardener).  If CRI configurations are not supported it is recommended create a validating webhook running in the garden cluster that prevents specifying the .spec.providers.workers[].cri section in the Shoot objects.\nReferences and additional resources  OperatingSystemConfig API (Golang specification) downloader script (fetching the \u0026ldquo;original\u0026rdquo; user-data and the execution script) Original user-data templates Execution script (applying the \u0026ldquo;original\u0026rdquo; user-data)  "},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/documentation/concepts/monitoring/operator_alerts/","title":"Operator Alerts","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Operator Alerts    Alertname Severity Type Description     ApiServerUnreachableViaKubernetesService critical shoot The Api server has been unreachable for 3 minutes via the kubernetes service in the shoot.

Gardener is evaluating the registrations and creates ControllerInstallation resources which describe the request \u0026ldquo;please install this controller X to this seed Y\u0026rdquo;.\nSimilar to how CloudProfile or Seed resources get into the system, the Gardener administrator must deploy the ControllerRegistration resources (this does not happen automatically in any way - the administrator decides which extensions shall be enabled).\nThe specification mainly describes which of Gardener\u0026rsquo;s extension CRDs are managed, for example:\napiVersion:core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1kind:ControllerRegistrationmetadata:name:os-coreosspec:resources:- kind:OperatingSystemConfigtype:coreosprimary:trueThis information tells Gardener that there is an extension controller that can handle OperatingSystemConfig resources of type coreos.\nAlso, it specifies that this controller is the primary one responsible for the lifecycle of the OperatingSystemConfig resource. Setting primary to false would allow to register additional, secondary controllers that may also watch/react on the OperatingSystemConfig/coreos resources, however, only the primary controller may change/update the main status of the extension object (that are used to \u0026ldquo;communicate\u0026rdquo; with the Gardenlet). Particularly, only the primary controller may set .status.lastOperation, .status.lastError, .status.observedGeneration, and .status.state. Secondary controllers may contribute to the .status.conditions[] if they like, of course.\nSecondary controllers might be helpful in scenarios where additional tasks need to be completed which are not part of the reconciliation logic of the primary controller but separated out into a dedicated extension.\n⚠️ There must be exactly one primary controller for every registered kind/type combination. Also, please note that the primary field cannot be changed after creation of the ControllerRegistration.\nDeploying Extension Controllers Submitting above ControllerRegistration will create a ControllerInstallation resource:\napiVersion:core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1kind:ControllerInstallationmetadata:name:os-coreosspec:registrationRef:apiVersion:core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1kind:ControllerRegistrationname:os-coreosseedRef:apiVersion:core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1kind:Seedname:aws-eu1This resource expresses that Gardener requires the os-coreos extension controller to run on the aws-eu1 seed cluster.\nThe Gardener Controller Manager does automatically determine which extension is required on which seed cluster and will only create ControllerInstallation objects for those. Also, it will automatically delete ControllerInstallations referencing extension controllers that are no longer required on a seed (e.g., because all shoots on it have been deleted). There are additional configuration options, please see this section.\nHow do extension controllers get deployed to seeds? After Gardener has written the ControllerInstallation resource some component must satisfy this request and start deploying the extension controller to the seed. Depending on the complexity of the controllers lifecycle management, configuration, etc. there are two possible scenarios:\nScenario 1: Deployed by Gardener In many cases the extension controllers are easy to deploy and configure. It is sufficient to simply create a Helm chart (standardized way of packaging software in the Kubernetes context) and deploy it together with some static configuration values. Gardener supports this scenario and allows to provide arbitrary deployment information in the ControllerRegistration resource\u0026rsquo;s .spec section:\n...spec:...deployment:type:helmproviderConfig:chart:H4sIFAAAAAAA/yk...values:foo:barIf .spec.deployment.type=helm then Gardener itself will take over the responsibility the deployment. It base64-decodes the provided Helm chart (.spec.deployment.providerConfig.chart) and deploys it with the provided static configuration (.spec.deployment.providerConfig.values). The chart and the values can be updated at any time - Gardener will recognize and re-trigger the deployment process.\nIn order to allow extensions to get information about the garden and the seed cluster Gardener does mix-in certain properties into the values (root level) of every deployed Helm chart:\ngardener:garden:identifier:\u0026lt;uuid-of-gardener-installation\u0026gt; seed:identifier:\u0026lt;seed-name\u0026gt; region: europespec:\u0026lt;complete-seed-spec\u0026gt;Extensions can use this information in their Helm chart in case they require knowledge about the garden and the seed environment. The list might be extended in the future.\n:information_source: Gardener uses the UUID of the garden Namespace object in the .gardener.garden.identifier property.\nScenario 2: Deployed by a (non-human) Kubernetes operator Some extension controllers might be more complex and require additional domain-specific knowledge wrt. lifecycle or configuration. In this case, we encourage to follow the Kubernetes operator pattern and deploy a dedicated operator for this extension into the garden cluster. The ControllerResource's .spec.deployment.type field would then not be helm, and no Helm chart or values need to be provided there. Instead, the operator itself knows how to deploy the extension into the seed. It must watch ControllerInstallation resources and act one those referencing a ControllerRegistration the operator is responsible for.\nIn order to let Gardener know that the extension controller is ready and running in the seed the ControllerInstallation's .status field supports two conditions: RegistrationValid and InstallationSuccessful - both must be provided by the responsible operator:\n...status:conditions:- lastTransitionTime:\u0026#34;2019-01-22T11:51:11Z\u0026#34;lastUpdateTime:\u0026#34;2019-01-22T11:51:11Z\u0026#34;message:Chartcouldberenderedsuccessfully.reason:RegistrationValidstatus:\u0026#34;True\u0026#34;type:Valid- lastTransitionTime:\u0026#34;2019-01-22T11:51:12Z\u0026#34;lastUpdateTime:\u0026#34;2019-01-22T11:51:12Z\u0026#34;message:Installationofnewresourcessucceeded.reason:InstallationSuccessfulstatus:\u0026#34;True\u0026#34;type:InstalledAdditionally, the .status field has a providerStatus section into which the operator can (optionally) put any arbitrary data associated with this installation.\nExtensions in the garden cluster itself The Shoot resource itself will contain some provider-specific data blobs. As a result, some extensions might also want to run in the garden cluster, e.g., to provide ValidatingWebhookConfigurations for validating the correctness of their provider-specific blobs:\napiVersion:core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1kind:Shootmetadata:name:johndoe-awsnamespace:garden-devspec:...cloud:type:awsregion:eu-west-1providerConfig:apiVersion:aws.cloud.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:InfrastructureConfignetworks:vpc:# specify either \u0026#39;id\u0026#39; or \u0026#39;cidr\u0026#39;# id: vpc-123456cidr:10.250.0.0/16internal:- 10.250.112.0/22public:- 10.250.96.0/22workers:- 10.250.0.0/19zones:- eu-west-1a...In the above example, Gardener itself does not understand the AWS-specific provider configuration for the infrastructure. However, if this part of the Shoot resource should be validated then you should run an AWS-specific component in the garden cluster that registers a webhook. You can do it similarly if you want to default some fields of a resource (by using a MutatingWebhookConfiguration).\nAgain, similar to how Gardener is deployed to the garden cluster, these components must be deployed and managed by the Gardener administrator.\nExtension resource configurations The Extension resource allows injecting arbitrary steps into the shoot reconciliation flow that are unknown to Gardener. Hence, it is slightly special and allows further configuration when registering it:\napiVersion:core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1kind:ControllerRegistrationmetadata:name:extension-foospec:resources:- kind:Extensiontype:fooprimary:truegloballyEnabled:truereconcileTimeout:30sThe globallyEnabled=true option specifies that the Extension/foo object shall be created by default for all shoots (unless they opted out by setting .spec.extensions[].enabled=false in the Shoot spec).\nThe reconcileTimeout tells Gardener how long it should wait during its shoot reconciliation flow for the Extension/foo's reconciliation to finish.\nDeployment configuration options The .spec.deployment resource allows to configure a deployment policy. There are the following policies:\n OnDemand (default): Gardener will demand the deployment and deletion of the extension controller to/from seed clusters dynamically. It will automatically determine (based on other resources like Shoots) whether it is required and decide accordingly. Always: Gardener will demand the deployment of the extension controller to seed clusters independent of whether it is actually required or not. This might be helpful if you want to add a new component/controller to all seed clusters by default. Another use-case is to minimize the durations until extension controllers get deployed and ready in case you have highly fluctuating seed clusters. AlwaysExceptNoShoots: Similar to Always, but if the seed does not have any shoots then the extension is not being deployed. It will be deleted from a seed after the last shoot has been removed from it.  Also, the .spec.deployment.seedSelector allows to specify a label selector for seed clusters. Only if it matches the labels of a seed then it will be deployed to it. Please note that a seed selector can only be specified for secondary controllers (primary=false for all .spec.resources[]).\n"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/v1.12.8/concepts/extensions/controllerregistration/","title":"Registering Extension Controllers","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Registering Extension Controllers Extensions are registered in the garden cluster via ControllerRegistration resources.

Hence, it is slightly special and allows further configuration when registering it:\napiVersion:core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1kind:ControllerRegistrationmetadata:name:extension-foospec:resources:- kind:Extensiontype:fooprimary:truegloballyEnabled:truereconcileTimeout:30sThe globallyEnabled=true option specifies that the Extension/foo object shall be created by default for all shoots (unless they opted out by setting .spec.extensions[].enabled=false in the Shoot spec).\nThe reconcileTimeout tells Gardener how long it should wait during its shoot reconciliation flow for the Extension/foo's reconciliation to finish.\nDeployment configuration options The .spec.deployment resource allows to configure a deployment policy. There are the following policies:\n OnDemand (default): Gardener will demand the deployment and deletion of the extension controller to/from seed clusters dynamically. It will automatically determine (based on other resources like Shoots) whether it is required and decide accordingly. Always: Gardener will demand the deployment of the extension controller to seed clusters independent of whether it is actually required or not. This might be helpful if you want to add a new component/controller to all seed clusters by default. Another use-case is to minimize the durations until extension controllers get deployed and ready in case you have highly fluctuating seed clusters. AlwaysExceptNoShoots: Similar to Always, but if the seed does not have any shoots then the extension is not being deployed. It will be deleted from a seed after the last shoot has been removed from it.  Also, the .spec.deployment.seedSelector allows to specify a label selector for seed clusters. Only if it matches the labels of a seed then it will be deployed to it. Please note that a seed selector can only be specified for secondary controllers (primary=false for all .spec.resources[]).\n"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/documentation/contribute/10_code/40_repositories/","title":"Repositories","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/v1.12.8/contribute/10_code/40_repositories/","title":"Repositories","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/v1.13.2/contribute/10_code/40_repositories/","title":"Repositories","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/documentation/guides/administer_shoots/dns_names/","title":"Request DNS Names","tags":[],"description":"Requesting DNS Names for Ingresses and Services in Shoot Clusters","content":"Request DNS Names in Shoot Clusters Introduction Within a shoot cluster, it is possible to request DNS records via the following resource types:\n Ingress Service DNSEntry  It is necessary that the Gardener installation your shoot cluster runs in is equipped with a shoot-dns-service extension.

If this is too long for you, you can read below how to get certificates by\n Certificate Resources Ingress Service  Restrictions Service Scope This service enables users to request managed X.509 certificates with the help of ACME and Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt.

A Certificate resource may be used to initiate a new certificate request as well as to manage its lifecycle. Gardener\u0026rsquo;s certificate service regularly checks the expiration timestamp of Certificates, triggers a renewal process if necessary and replaces the existing X.509 certificate with a new one.\n Your application should be able to reload replaced certificates in a timely manner to avoid service disruptions.\n Certificates can either be requested by creating Certificate resources in the Kubernetes cluster or by configuring Ingress or Service (type LoadBalancer) resources. If the latter is used, a Certificate resource will automatically be created by Gardener\u0026rsquo;s certificate service.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in the current progress of your request, you\u0026rsquo;re advised to consult the Certificate's status subresource.

Gardener let\u0026rsquo;s you request a commonly trusted X.509 certificate for your application endpoint. Furthermore, Gardener takes care about the renewal process for your requested certificate.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get the basics straight first. If this is too long for you, you can read below how to get certificates by\n Certificate Resources Ingress Service  Restrictions Service Scope This service enables users to request managed X.509 certificates with the help of ACME and Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt. It does not equip or manage DNS records for cluster assets like Services or Ingresses. Thus, you can obtain a valid certificate but your service might still not be resolvable or reachable due to missing DNS configuration. Please consult this page if your services require managed DNS records.\nSupported Domains Certificates may be obtained for any subdomain of your shoot\u0026rsquo;s domain (see .spec.dns.domain of your shoot resource) with the default issuer. For custom domains, please consult custom domains.\nCharacter Restrictions Due to the ACME protocol specification, at least one domain of the domains you request a certificate for must not exceed a character limit of 64 (CN - Common Name).\nFor example, the following request is invalid:\napiVersion:cert.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Certificatemetadata:name:cert-invalidnamespace:defaultspec:commonName:morethan64characters.ingress.shoot.project.default-domain.gardener.cloudBut it is valid to request a certificate for this domain if you have at least one domain which does not exceed the mentioned limit:\napiVersion:cert.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Certificatemetadata:name:cert-examplenamespace:defaultspec:commonName:short.ingress.shoot.project.default-domain.gardener.clouddnsNames:- morethan64characters.ingress.shoot.project.default-domain.gardener.cloudCertificate Resources Every X.509 certificate is represented by a Kubernetes custom resource certificate.cert.gardener.cloud in your cluster. A Certificate resource may be used to initiate a new certificate request as well as to manage its lifecycle. Gardener\u0026rsquo;s certificate service regularly checks the expiration timestamp of Certificates, triggers a renewal process if necessary and replaces the existing X.509 certificate with a new one.\n Your application should be able to reload replaced certificates in a timely manner to avoid service disruptions.\n Certificates can either be requested by creating Certificate resources in the Kubernetes cluster or by configuring Ingress or Service (type LoadBalancer) resources. If the latter is used, a Certificate resource will automatically be created by Gardener\u0026rsquo;s certificate service.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in the current progress of your request, you\u0026rsquo;re advised to consult the Certificate's status subresource.

The Gardener community has adopted this security disclosure and response policy to ensure we responsibly handle critical issues.\nGardener Security Team Security vulnerabilities should be handled quickly and sometimes privately. The primary goal of this process is to reduce the total time users are vulnerable to publicly known exploits. The Gardener Security Team is responsible for organizing the entire response including internal communication and external disclosure but will need help from relevant developers and release managers to successfully run this process. The initial Gardener Security Team will consist of the following volunteers:\n Olaf Beier, (@olafbeier) Vasu Chandrasekhara, (@vasu1124) Alban Crequy, (@alban) Norbert Hamann, (@norberthamann) Claudia Hölters, (@hoeltcl) Oliver Kling, (@oliverkling) Vedran Lerenc, (@vlerenc) Dirk Marwinski, (@marwinski) Michael Schubert, (@schu) Matthias Sohn, (@msohn) Frederik Thormaehlen, (@ThormaehlenFred) Christian Cwienk (@ccwienk)  Disclosures Private Disclosure Processes The Gardener community asks that all suspected vulnerabilities be privately and responsibly disclosed. If you\u0026rsquo;ve found a vulnerability or a potential vulnerability in Gardener please let us know by writing an e-mail to secure@sap.com. We\u0026rsquo;ll send a confirmation e-mail to acknowledge your report, and we\u0026rsquo;ll send an additional e-mail when we\u0026rsquo;ve identified the issue positively or negatively.\nPublic Disclosure Processes If you know of a publicly disclosed vulnerability please IMMEDIATELY e-mail to secure@sap.com to inform the Gardener Security Team about the vulnerability so they may start the patch, release, and communication process.\nIf possible the Gardener Security Team will ask the person making the public report if the issue can be handled via a private disclosure process (for example if the full exploit details have not yet been published). If the reporter denies the request for private disclosure, the Gardener Security Team will move swiftly with the fix and release process. In extreme cases GitHub can be asked to delete the issue but this generally isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary and is unlikely to make a public disclosure less damaging.\nPatch, Release, and Public Communication For each vulnerability a member of the Gardener Security Team will volunteer to lead coordination with the \u0026ldquo;Fix Team\u0026rdquo; and is responsible for sending disclosure e-mails to the rest of the community. This lead will be referred to as the \u0026ldquo;Fix Lead.\u0026rdquo; The role of the Fix Lead should rotate round-robin across the Gardener Security Team. Note that given the current size of the Gardener community it is likely that the Gardener Security Team is the same as the \u0026ldquo;Fix team.\u0026rdquo; (I.e., all maintainers). The Gardener Security Team may decide to bring in additional contributors for added expertise depending on the area of the code that contains the vulnerability. All of the time lines below are suggestions and assume a private disclosure. The Fix Lead drives the schedule using his best judgment based on severity and development time. If the Fix Lead is dealing with a public disclosure all time lines become ASAP (assuming the vulnerability has a CVSS score \u0026gt;= 7; see below). If the fix relies on another upstream project\u0026rsquo;s disclosure time line, that will adjust the process as well. We will work with the upstream project to fit their time line and best protect our users.\nFix Team Organization The Fix Lead will work quickly to identify relevant engineers from the affected projects and packages and CC those engineers into the disclosure thread. These selected developers are the Fix Team. The Fix Lead will give the Fix Team access to a private security repository to develop the fix.\nFix Development Process The Fix Lead and the Fix Team will create a CVSS using the CVSS Calculator. The Fix Lead makes the final call on the calculated CVSS; it is better to move quickly than make the CVSS perfect. The Fix Team will notify the Fix Lead that work on the fix branch is complete once there are LGTMs on all commits in the private repository from one or more maintainers. If the CVSS score is under 7.0 (a medium severity score) the Fix Team can decide to slow the release process down in the face of holidays, developer bandwidth, etc. These decisions must be discussed on the private Gardener Security mailing list.\nFix Disclosure Process With the fix development underway, the Fix Lead needs to come up with an overall communication plan for the wider community. This Disclosure process should begin after the Fix Team has developed a Fix or mitigation so that a realistic time line can be communicated to users. The Fix Lead will inform the Gardener mailing list that a security vulnerability has been disclosed and that a fix will be made available in the future on a certain release date. The Fix Lead will include any mitigating steps users can take until a fix is available. The communication to Gardener users should be actionable. They should know when to block time to apply patches, understand exact mitigation steps, etc.\nFix Release Day The Release Managers will ensure all the binaries are built, publicly available, and functional before the Release Date. The Release Managers will create a new patch release branch from the latest patch release tag + the fix from the security branch. As a practical example if v0.12.0 is the latest patch release in gardener.git a new branch will be created called v0.12.1 which includes only patches required to fix the issue. The Fix Lead will cherry-pick the patches onto the master branch and all relevant release branches. The Fix Team will LGTM and merge. The Release Managers will merge these PRs as quickly as possible. Changes shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be made to the commits even for a typo in the CHANGELOG as this will change the git sha of the already built and commits leading to confusion and potentially conflicts as the fix is cherry-picked around branches. The Fix Lead will request a CVE from the SAP Product Security Response Team via email to cna@sap.com with all the relevant information (description, potential impact, affected version, fixed version, CVSS v3 base score and supporting documentation for the CVSS score) for every vulnerability. The Fix Lead will inform the Gardener mailing list and announce the new releases, the CVE number (if available), the location of the binaries, and the relevant merged PRs to get wide distribution and user action.\nAs much as possible this e-mail should be actionable and include links how to apply the fix to users environments; this can include links to external distributor documentation. The recommended target time is 4pm UTC on a non-Friday weekday. This means the announcement will be seen morning Pacific, early evening Europe, and late evening Asia. The Fix Lead will remove the Fix Team from the private security repository.\nRetrospective These steps should be completed after the Release Date. The retrospective process should be blameless.\nThe Fix Lead will send a retrospective of the process to the Gardener mailing list including details on everyone involved, the time line of the process, links to relevant PRs that introduced the issue, if relevant, and any critiques of the response and release process. The Release Managers and Fix Team are also encouraged to send their own feedback on the process to the Gardener mailing list.

If you\u0026rsquo;ve found a vulnerability or a potential vulnerability in Gardener please let us know by writing an e-mail to secure@sap.com. We\u0026rsquo;ll send a confirmation e-mail to acknowledge your report, and we\u0026rsquo;ll send an additional e-mail when we\u0026rsquo;ve identified the issue positively or negatively.\nPublic Disclosure Processes If you know of a publicly disclosed vulnerability please IMMEDIATELY e-mail to secure@sap.com to inform the Gardener Security Team about the vulnerability so they may start the patch, release, and communication process.\nIf possible the Gardener Security Team will ask the person making the public report if the issue can be handled via a private disclosure process (for example if the full exploit details have not yet been published). If the reporter denies the request for private disclosure, the Gardener Security Team will move swiftly with the fix and release process. In extreme cases GitHub can be asked to delete the issue but this generally isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary and is unlikely to make a public disclosure less damaging.\nPatch, Release, and Public Communication For each vulnerability a member of the Gardener Security Team will volunteer to lead coordination with the \u0026ldquo;Fix Team\u0026rdquo; and is responsible for sending disclosure e-mails to the rest of the community. This lead will be referred to as the \u0026ldquo;Fix Lead.\u0026rdquo; The role of the Fix Lead should rotate round-robin across the Gardener Security Team. Note that given the current size of the Gardener community it is likely that the Gardener Security Team is the same as the \u0026ldquo;Fix team.\u0026rdquo; (I.e., all maintainers). The Gardener Security Team may decide to bring in additional contributors for added expertise depending on the area of the code that contains the vulnerability. All of the time lines below are suggestions and assume a private disclosure. The Fix Lead drives the schedule using his best judgment based on severity and development time. If the Fix Lead is dealing with a public disclosure all time lines become ASAP (assuming the vulnerability has a CVSS score \u0026gt;= 7; see below). If the fix relies on another upstream project\u0026rsquo;s disclosure time line, that will adjust the process as well. We will work with the upstream project to fit their time line and best protect our users.\nFix Team Organization The Fix Lead will work quickly to identify relevant engineers from the affected projects and packages and CC those engineers into the disclosure thread. These selected developers are the Fix Team. The Fix Lead will give the Fix Team access to a private security repository to develop the fix.\nFix Development Process The Fix Lead and the Fix Team will create a CVSS using the CVSS Calculator. The Fix Lead makes the final call on the calculated CVSS; it is better to move quickly than make the CVSS perfect. The Fix Team will notify the Fix Lead that work on the fix branch is complete once there are LGTMs on all commits in the private repository from one or more maintainers. If the CVSS score is under 7.0 (a medium severity score) the Fix Team can decide to slow the release process down in the face of holidays, developer bandwidth, etc. These decisions must be discussed on the private Gardener Security mailing list.\nFix Disclosure Process With the fix development underway, the Fix Lead needs to come up with an overall communication plan for the wider community. This Disclosure process should begin after the Fix Team has developed a Fix or mitigation so that a realistic time line can be communicated to users. The Fix Lead will inform the Gardener mailing list that a security vulnerability has been disclosed and that a fix will be made available in the future on a certain release date. The Fix Lead will include any mitigating steps users can take until a fix is available. The communication to Gardener users should be actionable. They should know when to block time to apply patches, understand exact mitigation steps, etc.\nFix Release Day The Release Managers will ensure all the binaries are built, publicly available, and functional before the Release Date. The Release Managers will create a new patch release branch from the latest patch release tag + the fix from the security branch. As a practical example if v0.12.0 is the latest patch release in gardener.git a new branch will be created called v0.12.1 which includes only patches required to fix the issue. The Fix Lead will cherry-pick the patches onto the master branch and all relevant release branches. The Fix Team will LGTM and merge. The Release Managers will merge these PRs as quickly as possible. Changes shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be made to the commits even for a typo in the CHANGELOG as this will change the git sha of the already built and commits leading to confusion and potentially conflicts as the fix is cherry-picked around branches. The Fix Lead will request a CVE from the SAP Product Security Response Team via email to cna@sap.com with all the relevant information (description, potential impact, affected version, fixed version, CVSS v3 base score and supporting documentation for the CVSS score) for every vulnerability. The Fix Lead will inform the Gardener mailing list and announce the new releases, the CVE number (if available), the location of the binaries, and the relevant merged PRs to get wide distribution and user action.\nAs much as possible this e-mail should be actionable and include links how to apply the fix to users environments; this can include links to external distributor documentation. The recommended target time is 4pm UTC on a non-Friday weekday. This means the announcement will be seen morning Pacific, early evening Europe, and late evening Asia. The Fix Lead will remove the Fix Team from the private security repository.\nRetrospective These steps should be completed after the Release Date. The retrospective process should be blameless.\nThe Fix Lead will send a retrospective of the process to the Gardener mailing list including details on everyone involved, the time line of the process, links to relevant PRs that introduced the issue, if relevant, and any critiques of the response and release process. The Release Managers and Fix Team are also encouraged to send their own feedback on the process to the Gardener mailing list. Honest critique is the only way we are going to get good at this as a community.\nCommunication Channel The private or public disclosure process should be triggered exclusively by writing an e-mail to secure@sap.com.\nGardener security announcements will be communicated by the Fix Lead sending an e-mail to the Gardener mailing list (reachable via gardener@googlegroups.com) as well as posting a link in the Gardener Slack channel.

Therefore it just registers the cluster where the Gardener is deployed on as a seed cluster. While this is easy, it might be insecure. Clusters created with Kubify don\u0026rsquo;t have network policies, for example. See Hardening the Gardener Community Setup for more information.\nTo have network policies on the seed cluster and avoid having the seed on the same cluster as the Gardener, the easiest option is probably to simply create a shoot and then register that shoot as seed. This way you can also leverage other advantages of shooted clusters for your seed, e.g. autoscaling.\nSetting up the Shoot The first step is to create a shoot cluster. Unfortunately, the Gardener dashboard currently does not allow to change the CIDRs for the created shoot clusters, and your shoots won\u0026rsquo;t work if they have overlapping CIDR ranges with their corresponding seed cluster. So either your seed cluster is deployed with different CIDRs - not using the dashboard, but kubectl apply and a yaml file - or all of your shoots on that seed need to be created this way. In order to be able to use the dashboard for the shoots, it makes sense to create the seed with different CIDRs.\nSo, create yourself a shoot with modified CIDRs. You can find templates for the shoot manifest here. You could, for example, change the CIDRs to this:\n...networks:internal:- 10.254.112.0/22nodes:10.254.0.0/19pods:10.255.0.0/17public:- 10.254.96.0/22services:10.255.128.0/17vpc:cidr:10.254.0.0/16workers:- 10.254.0.0/19...Also make sure that your new seed cluster has enough resources for the expected number of shoots.\nRegistering the Shoot as Seed The seed itself is a Kubernetes resource that can be deployed via a yaml file, but it has some dependencies. You can find templated versions of these files in the seed-config component of the landscape-setup-template project. If you have set up your Gardener using this project, there should also be rendered versions of these files in the state/seed-config/ directory of your landscape folder (they are probably easier to work with). Examples for all these files can also be found in the aforementioned example folder in the Gardener repo.\n1. Seed Namespace First, you should create a namespace for your new seed and everything that belongs to it. This is not necessary, but it will keep your cluster organized. For this example, the namespace will be called seed-test.\n2. Cloud Provider Secret The Gardener needs to create resources on the seed and thus needs a kubeconfig for it. It is provided with the cloud provider secret (below is an example for AWS).\napiVersion:v1kind:Secretmetadata:name:test-seed-secretnamespace:seed-testlabels:cloudprofile.garden.sapcloud.io/name:awstype:Opaquedata:accessKeyID:\u0026lt;base64-encodedAWSaccesskey\u0026gt; secretAccessKey: \u0026lt;base64-encoded AWS secret key\u0026gt;kubeconfig:\u0026lt;base64-encodedkubeconfig\u0026gt;Deploy the secret into your seed namespace.

This will prevent the Gardener from choosing this seed, so now all shoots created via the dashboard should have their control plane on the new, more secure seed.\n"},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/documentation/references/settings/","title":"Settings","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Packages:\n  settings.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1   settings.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1  Package v1alpha1 is a version of the API.\nResource Types:  ClusterOpenIDConnectPreset  OpenIDConnectPreset  ClusterOpenIDConnectPreset   ClusterOpenIDConnectPreset is a OpenID Connect configuration that is applied to a Shoot objects cluster-wide.\n   Field Description      apiVersion string   settings.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1      kind string  ClusterOpenIDConnectPreset    metadata  Kubernetes meta/v1.ObjectMeta     Standard object metadata.\nRefer to the Kubernetes API documentation for the fields of the metadata field.     spec  ClusterOpenIDConnectPresetSpec     Spec is the specification of this OpenIDConnect preset.\n     OpenIDConnectPresetSpec  OpenIDConnectPresetSpec      (Members of OpenIDConnectPresetSpec are embedded into this type.)     projectSelector  Kubernetes meta/v1.LabelSelector     (Optional) Project decides whether to apply the configuration if the Shoot is in a specific Project matching the label selector.

The mount is a pointer to an S3 location, so the data is never synced locally. Once mounted, any pod can read or even write from that directory without the need for explicit keys.\nHowever, it can be used to import and parse large amounts of data into a database.\nOverview Limitations Generally S3 cannot offer the same performance or semantics as a local file system. More specifically:\n random writes or appends to files require rewriting the entire file metadata operations such as listing directories have poor performance due to network latency eventual consistency can temporarily yield stale data(Amazon S3 Data Consistency Model) no atomic renames of files or directories no coordination between multiple clients mounting the same bucket no hard links  Before you Begin You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.

During maintenance operations, preview versions are excluded from updates, because they’re often recently released versions that haven’t yet undergone thorough testing and may contain bugs or security issues.\nMore information: Version Classifications.\nLet Gardener manage your updates The Maintenance Window Gardener can manage updates for you automatically. It offers users to specify a maintenance window during which updates are scheduled:\n The time interval of the maintenance window can’t be less than 30 minutes or more than 6 hours. If there’s no maintenance window specified during the creation of a shoot cluster, Gardener chooses a maintenance window randomly to spread the load.  You can either specify the maintenance window in the shoot cluster specification (.spec.maintenance.timeWindow) or the start time of the maintenance window using the Gardener dashboard (CLUSTERS \u0026gt; [YOUR-CLUSTER] \u0026gt; OVERVIEW \u0026gt; Lifecycle \u0026gt; Maintenance).\nAuto-Update and Forceful Updates To trigger updates during the maintenance window automatically, Gardener offers the following methods:\n  Auto-update: Gardener starts an update during the next maintenance window whenever there’s a version available in the CloudProfile that is higher than the one of your shoot cluster specification, and that isn’t classified as preview version. For Kubernetes versions, auto-update only updates to higher patch levels.\nYou can either activate auto-update on the Gardener dashboard (CLUSTERS \u0026gt; [YOUR-CLUSTER] \u0026gt; OVERVIEW \u0026gt; Lifecycle \u0026gt; Maintenance) or in the shoot cluster specification:\n .spec.maintenance.autoUpdate.kubernetesVersion: true .spec.maintenance.autoUpdate.machineImageVersion: true    Forceful updates: In the maintenance window, Gardener compares the current version given in the shoot cluster specification with the version list in the CloudProfile. If the version has an expiration date and if the date is before the start of the maintenance window, Gardener starts an update to the highest version available in the CloudProfile that isn’t classified as preview version. The highest version in CloudProfile can’t have an expiration date. For Kubernetes versions, Gardener only updates to higher patch levels or consecutive minor versions.\n  If you don’t want to wait for the next maintenance window, you can annotate the shoot cluster specification with shoot.gardener.cloud/operation: maintain. Gardener then checks immediately if there’s an auto-update or a forceful update needed.\n Forceful version updates are even executed if the auto-update for the Kubernetes version, or the auto-update for the machine image version is deactivated (set to `false`).  With expiration dates, administrators can give shoot cluster owners more time for testing before the actual version update happens, which allows smoother transitions to new versions.\nKubernetes Update Paths The bigger the delta of the Kubernetes source version and the Kubernetes target version, the better it must be planned and executed by operators. Gardener only provides automatic support for updates that can be applied safely to the cluster workload:\n   Update Type Example Update method     Patches 1.10.12 to 1.10.13 auto-update or Forceful update   Update to consecutive minor version 1.10.12 to 1.11.10 Forceful update   Other 1.10.12 to 1.12.0 manual update    Gardener doesn’t support automatic updates of nonconsecutive minor versions, because Kubernetes doesn’t guarantee updateability in this case. However, multiple minor version updates are possible if not only the minor source version is expired, but also the minor target version is expired. Gardener then updates the Kubernetes version first to the expired target version, and waits for the next maintenance window to update this version to the next minor target version.\n The administrator who maintains the `CloudProfile` has to ensure that the list of Kubernetes versions consists of consecutive minor versions, for example, from `1.10.x` to `1.11.y`. If the minor version increases in bigger steps, for example, from `1.10.x` to `1.12.y`, shoot cluster updates fail during the maintenance window.  Manual Updates To update the Kubernetes version or the node operating system manually, change the .spec.kubernetes.version field or the .spec.provider.workers.machine.image.version field correspondingly.\nManual updates are required if you would like to do a minor update of the Kubernetes version. Gardener doesn’t do such updates automatically as they can have breaking changes that could impact the cluster workload.\nManual updates are either executed immediately (default) or can be confined to the maintenance time window.\nChoosing the latter option, causes changes to the cluster (for example, node pool rolling-updates) and the subsequent reconciliation, to only predictably happen during a defined time window (available since Gardener version 1.4).\nMore information: Confine Specification Changes/Update Roll Out.\n Before applying such update on minor or major releases, operators should check for all the breaking changes introduced in the target Kubernetes release changelog.

For Kubernetes versions, auto-update only updates to higher patch levels.\nYou can either activate auto-update on the Gardener dashboard (CLUSTERS \u0026gt; [YOUR-CLUSTER] \u0026gt; OVERVIEW \u0026gt; Lifecycle \u0026gt; Maintenance) or in the shoot cluster specification:\n .spec.maintenance.autoUpdate.kubernetesVersion: true .spec.maintenance.autoUpdate.machineImageVersion: true    Forceful updates: In the maintenance window, Gardener compares the current version given in the shoot cluster specification with the version list in the CloudProfile. If the version has an expiration date and if the date is before the start of the maintenance window, Gardener starts an update to the highest version available in the CloudProfile that isn’t classified as preview version. The highest version in CloudProfile can’t have an expiration date. For Kubernetes versions, Gardener only updates to higher patch levels or consecutive minor versions.\n  If you don’t want to wait for the next maintenance window, you can annotate the shoot cluster specification with shoot.gardener.cloud/operation: maintain. Gardener then checks immediately if there’s an auto-update or a forceful update needed.\n Forceful version updates are even executed if the auto-update for the Kubernetes version, or the auto-update for the machine image version is deactivated (set to `false`).  With expiration dates, administrators can give shoot cluster owners more time for testing before the actual version update happens, which allows smoother transitions to new versions.\nKubernetes Update Paths The bigger the delta of the Kubernetes source version and the Kubernetes target version, the better it must be planned and executed by operators. Gardener only provides automatic support for updates that can be applied safely to the cluster workload:\n   Update Type Example Update method     Patches 1.10.12 to 1.10.13 auto-update or Forceful update   Update to consecutive minor version 1.10.12 to 1.11.10 Forceful update   Other 1.10.12 to 1.12.0 manual update    Gardener doesn’t support automatic updates of nonconsecutive minor versions, because Kubernetes doesn’t guarantee updateability in this case. However, multiple minor version updates are possible if not only the minor source version is expired, but also the minor target version is expired. Gardener then updates the Kubernetes version first to the expired target version, and waits for the next maintenance window to update this version to the next minor target version.\n The administrator who maintains the `CloudProfile` has to ensure that the list of Kubernetes versions consists of consecutive minor versions, for example, from `1.10.x` to `1.11.y`. If the minor version increases in bigger steps, for example, from `1.10.x` to `1.12.y`, shoot cluster updates fail during the maintenance window.  Manual Updates To update the Kubernetes version or the node operating system manually, change the .spec.kubernetes.version field or the .spec.provider.workers.machine.image.version field correspondingly.\nManual updates are required if you would like to do a minor update of the Kubernetes version. Gardener doesn’t do such updates automatically as they can have breaking changes that could impact the cluster workload.\nManual updates are either executed immediately (default) or can be confined to the maintenance time window.\nChoosing the latter option, causes changes to the cluster (for example, node pool rolling-updates) and the subsequent reconciliation, to only predictably happen during a defined time window (available since Gardener version 1.4).\nMore information: Confine Specification Changes/Update Roll Out.\n Before applying such update on minor or major releases, operators should check for all the breaking changes introduced in the target Kubernetes release changelog.  Examples In the examples for the CloudProfile and the shoot cluster specification, only the fields relevant for the example are shown.\nAuto-Update of Kubernetes Version Let\u0026rsquo;s assume Kubernetes version 1.10.5 and 1.11.0 were added in the following CloudProfile:\nspec:kubernetes:versions:- version:1.11.0- version:1.10.5- version:1.10.0Before this change, the shoot cluster specification looked like this:\nspec:kubernetes:version:1.10.0maintenance:timeWindow:begin:220000+0000end:230000+0000autoUpdate:kubernetesVersion:trueAs a consequence, the shoot cluster is updated to Kubernetes version 1.10.5 between 22:00-23:00 UTC. Your shoot cluster isn\u0026rsquo;t updated automatically to 1.11.0 even though it\u0026rsquo;s the highest Kubernetes version in the CloudProfile, because Gardener does only do automatic updates of the Kubernetes patch level.\nForceful Update Due to Expired Kubernetes Version Let\u0026rsquo;s assume the following CloudProfile:\nspec:kubernetes:versions:- version:1.12.8- version:1.11.10- version:1.10.13- version:1.10.12expirationDate:\u0026#34;2019-04-13T08:00:00Z\u0026#34;Let\u0026rsquo;s assume the shoot cluster has the following specification:\nspec:kubernetes:version:1.10.12maintenance:timeWindow:begin:220000+0100end:230000+0100autoUpdate:kubernetesVersion:falseThe shoot cluster specification refers a Kubernetes version that has an expirationDate.

In the maintenance window on 2019-04-14, the Kubernetes version of the shoot cluster is updated to 1.11.10, which is the highest patch version of minor target version 1.11 that follows source version 1.10.\nAutomatic Update from Expired Machine Image Version Let\u0026rsquo;s assume the following CloudProfile:\nspec:machineImages:- name:coreosversions:- version:2191.5.0- version:2191.4.1- version:2135.6.0expirationDate:\u0026#34;2019-04-13T08:00:00Z\u0026#34;Let\u0026rsquo;s assume the shoot cluster has the following specification:\nspec:provider:type:awsworkers:- name:namemaximum:1minimum:1maxSurge:1maxUnavailable:0image:name:coreosversion:2135.6.0type:m5.largevolume:type:gp2size:20Gimaintenance:timeWindow:begin:220000+0100end:230000+0100autoUpdate:machineImageVersion:falseThe shoot cluster specification refers a machine image version that has an expirationDate.

Both applications offer a wide range of flexibility which needs to be considered in case you have specific requirenments. Such advanced details are not in the scope of this post.\nIntroduction Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit for recording numeric time series. It fits both machine-centric monitoring as well as monitoring of highly dynamic service-oriented architectures.

Results can either be shown as a graph, viewed as tabular data in the Prometheus expression browser, or consumed by external systems via the HTTP API.\n  Find query examples on Prometheus Query Examples.\nOne very popular open-source visualization tool not only for Prometheus is Grafana. Grafana is a metric analytics and visualization suite. It is popular for for visualizing time series data for infrastructure and application analytics but many use it in other domains including industrial sensors, home automation, weather, and process control [see Grafana Documentation].\nGrafana accesses data via Data Sources. The continuously growing list of supported backends includes Prometheus.\nDashboards are created by combining panels, e.g. Graph and Dashlist.\nIn this example we describe an End-To-End scenario including the deployment of Prometheus and a basic monitoring configuration as the one provided for Kubernetes clusters created by Gardener.\nIf you miss elements on the Prometheus web page when accessing it via its service URL https://\u0026lt;your K8s FQN\u0026gt;/api/v1/namespaces/\u0026lt;your-prometheus-namespace\u0026gt;/services/prometheus-prometheus-server:80/proxy this is probably caused by Prometheus issue #1583 To workaround this issue setup a port forward kubectl port-forward -n \u0026lt;your-prometheus-namespace\u0026gt; \u0026lt;prometheus-pod\u0026gt; 9090:9090 on your client and access the Prometheus UI from there with your locally installed web browser. This issue is not relevant in case you use the service type LoadBalancer.\nPreparation The deployment of Prometheus and Grafana is based on Helm charts.\nMake sure to implement the Helm settings before deploying the Helm charts.\nThe Kubernetes clusters provided by Gardener use role based access control (RBAC). To authorize the Prometheus node-exporter to access hardware and OS relevant metrics of your cluster\u0026rsquo;s worker nodes specific artifacts need to be deployed.\nBind the prometheus service account to the garden.sapcloud.io:monitoring:prometheus cluster role by running the command kubectl apply -f crbinding.yaml.\nContent of crbinding.yaml\napiVersion:rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1kind:ClusterRoleBindingmetadata:name:\u0026lt;your-prometheus-name\u0026gt;-serverroleRef:apiGroup:rbac.authorization.k8s.iokind:ClusterRolename:garden.sapcloud.io:monitoring:prometheussubjects:- kind:ServiceAccountname:\u0026lt;your-prometheus-name\u0026gt;-servernamespace:\u0026lt;your-prometheus-namespace\u0026gt;Deployment of Prometheus and Grafana Only minor changes are needed to deploy Prometheus and Grafana based on Helm charts.\nCopy the following configuration into a file called values.yaml and deploy Prometheus: helm install \u0026lt;your-prometheus-name\u0026gt; --namespace \u0026lt;your-prometheus-namespace\u0026gt; stable/prometheus -f values.yaml\nTypically, Prometheus and Grafana are deployed into the same namespace.

Since the deployment in this post is based on the Helm default values, the settings below are set explicitly in case the default changed. Deploy Grafana via helm install grafana --namespace \u0026lt;your-prometheus-namespace\u0026gt; stable/grafana -f values.yaml. Here, the same namespace is chosen for Prometheus and for Grafana.\nContent of values.yaml for Grafana:\nserver:ingress:enabled:falseservice:type:ClusterIPCheck the running state of the pods on the Kubernetes Dashboard or by running kubectl get pods -n \u0026lt;your-prometheus-namespace\u0026gt;. In case of errors check the log files of the pod(s) in question.\nThe text output of Helm after the deployment of Prometheus and Grafana contains very useful information, e.g. the user and password of the Grafana Admin user. The credentials are stored as secrets in the namespace \u0026lt;your-prometheus-namespace\u0026gt; and could be decoded via kubectl get secret --namespace \u0026lt;my-grafana-namespace\u0026gt; grafana -o jsonpath=\u0026quot;{.data.admin-password}\u0026quot; | base64 --decode ; echo.\nBasic functional tests To access the web UI of both applications use port forwarding of port 9090.\nSetup port forwarding for port 9090:\nkubectl port-forward -n \u0026lt;your-prometheus-namespace\u0026gt; \u0026lt;your-prometheus-server-pod\u0026gt; 9090:9090 Open http://localhost:9090 in your web browser. Select Graph from the top tab and enter the following expressing to show the overall CPU usage for a server (see Prometheus Query Examples)\n100 * (1 - avg by(instance)(irate(node_cpu{mode=\u0026#39;idle\u0026#39;}[5m]))) This should show some data in a graph.\nTo show the same data in Grafana setup port forwarding for port 3000 for the Grafana pod and open the Grafana Web UI by opening http://localhost:3000 in a browser. Enter the credentials of the admin user.\nNext, you need to enter the server name of your Prometheus deployment. This name is shown directly after the installation via helm.\nRun\nhelm status \u0026lt;your-prometheus-name\u0026gt; to find this name. Below this server name is referenced by \u0026lt;your-prometheus-server-name\u0026gt;.\nFirst, you need to add your Prometheus server as data source.\n select Dashboards → Data Sources select Add data source enter Name: \u0026lt;your-prometheus-datasource-name\u0026gt;\nType: Prometheus\nURL: http://\u0026lt;your-prometheus-server-name\u0026gt;\n_Access: proxy select Save \u0026amp; Test  In case of failure check the Prometheus URL in the Kubernetes Dashboard.\nTo add a Graph follow these steps:\n in the left corner, select Dashboards → New to create a new dashboard select Graph to create a new graph next, select the Panel Title → Edit select your Prometheus Data Source in the drop down list enter the expression 100 * (1 - avg by(instance)(irate(node_cpu{mode='idle'}[5m]))) in the entry field A select the floppy disk symbol (Save) on top  Now you should have a very basic Prometheus and Grafana setup for your Kubernetes cluster.\nAs a next step you can implement monitoring for your applications by implementing the Prometheus client API.\nLinks  Prometheus Prometheus Helm Chart Prometheus and Kubernetes: A Perfect Match Grafana Grafana Helm Chart  "},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/v1.12.8/guides/applications/prometheus/","title":"Using Prometheus and Grafana to monitor K8s","tags":[],"description":"How to deploy and configure Prometheus and Grafana to collect and monitor kubelet container metrics","content":"Disclaimer This post is meant to give a basic end-to-end description for deploying and using Prometheus and Grafana.

Both applications offer a wide range of flexibility which needs to be considered in case you have specific requirenments. Such advanced details are not in the scope of this post.\nIntroduction Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit for recording numeric time series. It fits both machine-centric monitoring as well as monitoring of highly dynamic service-oriented architectures. In a world of microservices, its support for multi-dimensional data collection and querying is a particular strength.\nPrometheus graduates within CNCF second hosted project.\nThe following characteristics make Prometheus a good match for monitoring Kubernetes clusters:\n  Pull-based monitoring\nPrometheus is a pull-based monitoring system, which means that the Prometheus server dynamically discovers and pulls metrics from your services running in Kubernetes.\n  Labels Prometheus and Kubernetes share the same label (key-value) concept that can be used to select objects in the system.\nLabels are used to identify time series and sets of label matchers can be used in the query language ( PromQL ) to select the time series to be aggregated..\n  Exporters\nThere are many exporters available which enable integration of databases or even other monitoring systems not already providing a way to export metrics to Prometheus. One prominent exporter is the so called node-exporter, which allows to monitor hardware and OS related metrics of Unix systems.\n  Powerful query language\nThe Prometheus query language PromQL lets the user select and aggregate time series data in real time. Results can either be shown as a graph, viewed as tabular data in the Prometheus expression browser, or consumed by external systems via the HTTP API.\n  Find query examples on Prometheus Query Examples.\nOne very popular open-source visualization tool not only for Prometheus is Grafana.

The Gardener project features a sub-project called machine-controller-manager. This controller is extending the Kubernetes API using custom resource definitions to represent actual VMs as Machine objects inside a Kubernetes system. This approach unlocks the possibility to manage virtual machines in the Kubernetes style and benefit from all its design principles.\nWhat is the machine-controller-manager exactly doing? Generally, there are provider-specific MachineClass objects (AWSMachineClass, AzureMachineClass, etc.; similar to StorageClass), and MachineDeployment, MachineSet, and Machine objects (similar to Deployment, ReplicaSet, and Pod). A machine class describes where and how to create virtual machines (in which networks, region, availability zone, SSH key, user-data for bootstrapping, etc.) while a Machine results in an actual virtual machine. You can read up more information in the machine-controller-manager\u0026rsquo;s repository.\nBefore the introduction of the Worker extension resource Gardener was deploying the machine-controller-manager, the machine classes, and the machine deployments itself. Now, Gardener commissions an external, provider-specific controller to take over these tasks.\nWhat needs to be implemented to support a new worker provider? As part of the shoot flow Gardener will create a special CRD in the seed cluster that needs to be reconciled by an extension controller, for example:\n---apiVersion:extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Workermetadata:name:barnamespace:shoot--foo--barspec:type:azureregion:eu-west-1secretRef:name:cloudprovidernamespace:shoot--foo--barinfrastructureProviderStatus:apiVersion:aws.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:InfrastructureStatusec2:keyName:shoot--foo--bar-ssh-publickeyiam:instanceProfiles:- name:shoot--foo--bar-nodespurpose:nodesroles:- arn:arn:aws:iam::0123456789:role/shoot--foo--bar-nodespurpose:nodesvpc:id:vpc-0123456789securityGroups:- id:sg-1234567890purpose:nodessubnets:- id:subnet-01234purpose:nodeszone:eu-west-1b- id:subnet-56789purpose:publiczone:eu-west-1b- id:subnet-0123apurpose:nodeszone:eu-west-1c- id:subnet-5678apurpose:publiczone:eu-west-1cpools:- name:cpu-workerminimum:3maximum:5maxSurge:1maxUnavailable:0machineType:m4.largemachineImage:name:coreosversion:1967.5.0userData:c29tZSBkYXRhIHRvIGJvb3RzdHJhcCB0aGUgVk0Kvolume:size:20Gitype:gp2zones:- eu-west-1b- eu-west-1cmachineControllerManager:drainTimeout:10mhealthTimeout:10mcreationTimeout:10mmaxEvictRetries:30nodeConditions:- ReadonlyFilesystem- DiskPressure- KernelDeadlockThe .spec.secretRef contains a reference to the provider secret pointing to the account that shall be used to create the needed virtual machines. Also, as you can see, Gardener copies the output of the infrastructure creation (.spec.infrastructureProviderStatus), see Infrastructure resource, into the .spec.\nIn the .spec.pools[] field the desired worker pools are listed. In the above example, one pool with machine type m4.large and min=3, max=5 machines shall be spread over two availability zones (eu-west-1b, eu-west-1c). This information together with the infrastructure status must be used to determine the proper configuration for the machine classes.\nThe spec.pools[].machineControllerManager field allows to configure the settings for machine-controller-manager component.

Gardener deploys this autoscaler if there is at least one worker pool that specifies max\u0026gt;min. In order to know how it needs to configure it, the provider-specific Worker extension controller must expose which MachineDeployments it had created and how the min/max numbers should look like.\nConsequently, your controller should write this information into the Worker resource\u0026rsquo;s .status.machineDeployments field:\n---apiVersion:extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Workermetadata:name:workernamespace:shoot--foo--barspec:...status:lastOperation:...machineDeployments:- name:shoot--foo--bar-cpu-worker-z1minimum:2maximum:3- name:shoot--foo--bar-cpu-worker-z2minimum:1maximum:2In order to support a new worker provider you need to write a controller that watches all Workers with .spec.type=\u0026lt;my-provider-name\u0026gt;. You can take a look at the below referenced example implementation for the AWS provider.\nThat sounds like a lot that needs to be done, can you help me? All of the described behaviour is mostly the same for every provider. The only difference is maybe the version/configuration of the machine-controller-manager, and the machine class specification itself. You can take a look at our extension library, especially the worker controller part where you will find a lot of utilities that you can use. Also, using the library you only need to implement your provider specifics - all the things that can be handled generically can be taken for free and do not need to be re-implemented. Take a look at the AWS worker controller for finding an example.\nNon-provider specific information required for worker creation All the providers require further information that is not provider specific but already part of the shoot resource. One example for such information is whether the shoot is hibernated or not. In this case all the virtual machines should be deleted/terminated, and after that the machine controller-manager should be scaled down. You can take a look at the AWS worker controller to see how it reads this information and how it is used. As Gardener cannot know which information is required by providers it simply mirrors the Shoot, Seed, and CloudProfile resources into the seed. They are part of the Cluster extension resource and can be used to extract information that is not part of the Worker resource itself.\nReferences and additional resources  Worker API (Golang specification) Extension controller library Generic worker controller Exemplary implementation for the AWS provider  "},{"uri":"https://gardener.cloud/v1.12.8/concepts/extensions/worker/","title":"Worker resource","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Contract: Worker resource While the control plane of a shoot cluster is living in the seed and deployed as native Kubernetes workload, the worker nodes of the shoot clusters are normal virtual machines (VMs) in the end-users infrastructure account.

In order to know how it needs to configure it, the provider-specific Worker extension controller must expose which MachineDeployments it had created and how the min/max numbers should look like.\nConsequently, your controller should write this information into the Worker resource\u0026rsquo;s .status.machineDeployments field:\n---apiVersion:extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1kind:Workermetadata:name:workernamespace:shoot--foo--barspec:...status:lastOperation:...machineDeployments:- name:shoot--foo--bar-cpu-worker-z1minimum:2maximum:3- name:shoot--foo--bar-cpu-worker-z2minimum:1maximum:2In order to support a new worker provider you need to write a controller that watches all Workers with .spec.type=\u0026lt;my-provider-name\u0026gt;. You can take a look at the below referenced example implementation for the AWS provider.\nThat sounds like a lot that needs to be done, can you help me? All of the described behaviour is mostly the same for every provider. The only difference is maybe the version/configuration of the machine-controller-manager, and the machine class specification itself. You can take a look at our extension library, especially the worker controller part where you will find a lot of utilities that you can use. Also, using the library you only need to implement your provider specifics - all the things that can be handled generically can be taken for free and do not need to be re-implemented. Take a look at the AWS worker controller for finding an example.\nNon-provider specific information required for worker creation All the providers require further information that is not provider specific but already part of the shoot resource. One example for such information is whether the shoot is hibernated or not. In this case all the virtual machines should be deleted/terminated, and after that the machine controller-manager should be scaled down. You can take a look at the AWS worker controller to see how it reads this information and how it is used. As Gardener cannot know which information is required by providers it simply mirrors the Shoot, Seed, and CloudProfile resources into the seed. They are part of the Cluster extension resource and can be used to extract information that is not part of the Worker resource itself.\nReferences and additional resources  Worker API (Golang specification) Extension controller library Generic worker controller Exemplary implementation for the AWS provider  "}]
