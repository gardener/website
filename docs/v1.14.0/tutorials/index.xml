This is desired when you have work loads that need to scale up quickly without waiting for the new cluster nodes to be created and join the cluster.
A similar problem occurs when crashing a node from the Hyperscaler. This must be replaced by Kubernetes as fast as possible. The solution can be overprovisioning of nodes</description></item><item><title>Feature Flags in Kubernetes Applications</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/v1.14.0/tutorials/kube-featureflag/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/v1.14.0/tutorials/kube-featureflag/</guid><description>Feature Flags in Kubernetes Applications Feature flags are used to change the behavior of a program at runtime without forcing a restart.
Although they are essential in a native cloud environment, they cannot be implemented without significant effort on some platforms. Kubernetes has made this trivial. Here we will implement them through labels and annotations, but you can also implement them by connecting directly to the Kubernetes API Server.
In Kubernetes, labels are part of the identity of a resource and can be used through selectors.</description></item></channel></rss>
