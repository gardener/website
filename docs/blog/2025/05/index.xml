Recently, new functionalities have been introduced to streamline the process of adding worker nodes to these clusters: the &lt;code>gardenadm token&lt;/code> command suite and the corresponding &lt;code>gardenadm join&lt;/code> command. These additions offer a more convenient and Kubernetes-native experience for cluster expansion.&lt;/p>

The new &lt;code>gardenadm token&lt;/code> command provides a set of subcommands to manage these tokens effectively within your autonomous Shoot cluster&amp;rsquo;s control plane node. This functionality is analogous to the familiar &lt;code>kubeadm token&lt;/code> commands.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enhanced Network Flexibility: Gardener Now Supports CIDR Overlap for Non-HA Shoots</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/blog/2025/05/05-19-enhanced-network-flexibility-gardener-now-supports-cidr-overlap-for-non-ha-shoots/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/blog/2025/05/05-19-enhanced-network-flexibility-gardener-now-supports-cidr-overlap-for-non-ha-shoots/</guid><description>&lt;p>Gardener is continually evolving to offer greater flexibility and efficiency in managing Kubernetes clusters. A significant enhancement has been introduced that addresses a common networking challenge: the requirement for completely disjoint network CIDR blocks between a shoot cluster and its seed cluster. Now, Gardener allows for IPv4 network overlap in specific scenarios, providing users with more latitude in their network planning.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="addressing-ip-address-constraints">Addressing IP Address Constraints&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#addressing-ip-address-constraints" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Previously, all shoot cluster networks (pods, services, nodes) had to be distinct from the seed cluster&amp;rsquo;s networks. This could be challenging in environments with limited IP address space or complex network topologies. With this new feature, IPv4 or dual-stack shoot clusters can now define pod, service, and node networks that overlap with the IPv4 networks of their seed cluster.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gardener Dashboard 1.80: Streamlined Credentials, Enhanced Cluster Views, and Real-Time Updates</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/blog/2025/05/05-19-gardener-dashboard-180-streamlined-credentials-enhanced-cluster-views-and-real-time-updates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/blog/2025/05/05-19-gardener-dashboard-180-streamlined-credentials-enhanced-cluster-views-and-real-time-updates/</guid><description>&lt;p>Gardener Dashboard version 1.80 introduces several significant enhancements aimed at improving user experience, credentials management, and overall operational efficiency. These updates bring more clarity to credential handling, a smoother experience for managing large numbers of clusters, and a move towards a more reactive interface.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="unified-and-enhanced-credentials-management">Unified and Enhanced Credentials Management&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#unified-and-enhanced-credentials-management" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The management of secrets and credentials has been significantly revamped for better clarity and functionality:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Introducing CredentialsBindings:&lt;/strong> The dashboard now fully supports &lt;code>CredentialsBinding&lt;/code> resources alongside the existing &lt;code>SecretBinding&lt;/code> resources. This allows for referencing both Secrets and, in the future, Workload Identities more explicitly. While &lt;code>CredentialsBindings&lt;/code> referencing Workload Identity resources are visible for cluster creation, editing or deleting them via the dashboard is not yet supported.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Credentials&amp;rdquo; Page:&lt;/strong> The former &amp;ldquo;Secrets&amp;rdquo; page has been renamed to &amp;ldquo;Credentials.&amp;rdquo; It features a new &amp;ldquo;Kind&amp;rdquo; column and distinct icons to clearly differentiate between &lt;code>SecretBinding&lt;/code> and &lt;code>CredentialsBinding&lt;/code> types, especially useful when resources share names. The column showing the referenced credential resource name has been removed as this information is part of the binding&amp;rsquo;s details.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Contextual Information and Safeguards:&lt;/strong> When editing a secret, all its associated data is now displayed, providing better context. If an underlying secret is referenced by multiple bindings, a hint is shown to prevent unintended impacts. Deletion of a binding is prevented if the underlying secret is still in use by another binding.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Simplified Creation and Editing:&lt;/strong> New secrets created via the dashboard will now automatically generate a &lt;code>CredentialsBinding&lt;/code>. While existing &lt;code>SecretBindings&lt;/code> remain updatable, the creation of new &lt;code>SecretBindings&lt;/code> through the dashboard is no longer supported, encouraging the adoption of the more versatile &lt;code>CredentialsBinding&lt;/code>. The edit dialog for secrets now pre-fills current data, allowing for easier modification of specific fields.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Handling Missing Secrets:&lt;/strong> The UI now provides clear information and guidance if a &lt;code>CredentialsBinding&lt;/code> or &lt;code>SecretBinding&lt;/code> references a secret that no longer exists.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

For enterprises seeking to provision and manage Kubernetes clusters efficiently, securely, and at scale, a robust and comprehensive solution is paramount. Gardener, born from years of managing tens of thousands of clusters efficiently across diverse platforms and in demanding environments, stands out as a fully open-source choice for delivering fully managed Kubernetes Clusters as a Service. It already empowers organizations like SAP, STACKIT, T-Systems, and others (see &lt;a href="https://gardener.cloud/adopter">adopters&lt;/a>) and has become a core technology for &lt;a href="https://neonephos.org/projects">NeoNephos&lt;/a>, a project aimed at advancing digital autonomy in Europe (see &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85MDID9Ju04&amp;amp;t=621s">KubeCon London 2025 Keynote&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://neonephos.org/2025/03/31/the-linux-foundation-announces-the-launch-of-neonephos-to-advance-digital-autonomy-in-europe">press announcement&lt;/a>).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
