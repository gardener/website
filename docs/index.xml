Manages TLS certificates in Kubernetes clusters using custom resources.
In a multi-cluster environment like Gardener, using existing open source projects for certificate management like cert-manager becomes cumbersome. With this project the separation of concerns between multiple clusters is realized more easily. The cert-controller-manager runs in a secured cluster where the issuer secrets are stored. At the same time it watches an untrusted source cluster and can provide certificates for it.</description></item><item><title>Certificates Management</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/v1.12.8/concepts/networking/cert-managment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/v1.12.8/concepts/networking/cert-managment/</guid><description>cert-management

Here are some of the highlights:
A completely new landing page, emphasizing both on Gardener&amp;rsquo;s value proposition and the open community behind it. The Community page was reconstructed for quick access to the various community channels and will soon merge the Adopters page. It will provide a better insight into success stories from the communty. A completely new News section and content type available at /documentation/news.</description></item><item><title>Alerting</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/documentation/concepts/monitoring/alerting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/documentation/concepts/monitoring/alerting/</guid><description>Alerting Gardener uses Prometheus to gather metrics from each component.

This is desired when you have work loads that need to scale up quickly without waiting for the new cluster nodes to be created and join the cluster.
A similar problem occurs when crashing a node from the Hyperscaler. This must be replaced by Kubernetes as fast as possible. The solution can be overprovisioning of nodes</description></item><item><title>Cluster resource</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/documentation/concepts/extensions/cluster/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/documentation/concepts/extensions/cluster/</guid><description>Cluster resource As part of the extensibility epic a lot of responsibility that was previously taken over by Gardener directly has now been shifted to extension controllers running in the seed clusters.
