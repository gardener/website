This interactive playground is designed to provide you with a hands-on experience of Gardener, our open-source project that offers a Kubernetes-based solution for managing Kubernetes clusters across various cloud providers uniformly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-a-demo-environment">Why a Demo Environment?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We understand that the best way to learn is by doing.
That&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;ve created this demo environment.
It&amp;rsquo;s a space where you can experiment with Gardener, explore its features, and see firsthand how it can simplify your Kubernetes operations - all without having to install anything on your local machine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PromCon EU 2024 Highlights</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/blog/2024/11-06-promcon-eu-2024/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/blog/2024/11-06-promcon-eu-2024/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many innovative observability and application performance management (APM) products and services were released over the last few years. They often adopt or enhance concepts that Prometheus invented more than a decade ago. However, Prometheus, as an open-source project, has never lost its importance in this fast-moving industry and is the core of Gardener&amp;rsquo;s monitoring stack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On September 11th and 12th, Prometheus developers and users met for PromCon EU 2024 in Berlin. The single-track conference provided a good mix of talks about the latest Prometheus development and governance by many core contributors, as well as users who shared their experiences with monitoring in a cloud-native environment. The overarching topic of the event was the upcoming Prometheus 3.0 release. Many of the presented innovations will also be interesting for the future of Gardener&amp;rsquo;s observability stack. We will take a closer look at the changes in the Prometheus and Perses projects in the remainder of this article.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gardener at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2024</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/blog/2024/10-24-gardener-kubecon-cloudnativecon-na-2024-announcement/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/blog/2024/10-24-gardener-kubecon-cloudnativecon-na-2024-announcement/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/">KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA&lt;/a> is just around the corner, taking place this year amidst the stunning backdrop of the Rocky Mountains in Salt Lake City, Utah.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Gardener community recently concluded its &lt;a href="https://github.com/gardener-community/hackathon/blob/main/2024-05_Schelklingen/README.md">5th Hackathon&lt;/a>, a week-long event that brought together multiple companies to collaborate on common topics of interest. The Hackathon, held at &lt;a href="https://www.schlosshof-info.de/">Schlosshof Freizeitheim&lt;/a> in &lt;a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/28FZXpzZLjgaKNef9">Schelklingen, Germany&lt;/a>, was a testament to the power of collective effort and open-source, producing a tremendous number of results in a short time and moving the Gardener project forward with innovative solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-week-of-collaboration-and-innovation">A Week of Collaboration and Innovation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Hackathon addressed a wide range of topics, from improving the maturity of the Gardener API to harmonizing development setups and automating additional preparation tasks for Gardener installations. The event also saw the introduction of new resources and configurations, the rewriting of VPN components from Bash to Golang, and the exploration of a Tailscale-based VPN to secure shoot clusters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gardener's Registry Cache Extension: Another Cost Saving Win and More</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/blog/2024/04-22-gardeners-registry-cache-extension-another-cost-saving-win-and-more/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/blog/2024/04-22-gardeners-registry-cache-extension-another-cost-saving-win-and-more/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In Kubernetes, on every Node the container runtime daemon pulls the container images that are configured in the Pods&amp;rsquo; specifications running on the corresponding Node. Although these container images are cached on the Node&amp;rsquo;s file system after the initial pull operation, there are imperfections with this setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>New Nodes are often created due to events such as auto-scaling (scale up), rolling updates, or replacements of unhealthy Nodes. A new Node would need to pull the images running on it from the container registry because the Node&amp;rsquo;s cache is initially empty. Pulling an image from a registry incurs network traffic and registry costs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SpinKube on Gardener - Serverless WASM on Kubernetes</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/blog/2024/04-18-spinkube-gardener-shoot-cluster/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/blog/2024/04-18-spinkube-gardener-shoot-cluster/</guid><description>&lt;p>With the rising popularity of &lt;a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly (WASM)&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://wasi.dev/">WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)&lt;/a> comes a variety of integration possibilities. WASM is now not only suitable for the browser, but can be also utilized for running workloads on the server. In this post we will explore how you can get started writing serverless applications powered by &lt;a href="https://www.spinkube.dev/">SpinKube&lt;/a> on a Gardener Shoot cluster. This post is inspired by a similar tutorial that goes through the steps of &lt;a href="https://www.spinkube.dev/docs/spin-operator/tutorials/deploy-on-azure-kubernetes-service/">Deploying the Spin Operator on Azure Kubernetes Service&lt;/a>. Keep in mind that this post does not aim to define a production environment. It is meant to show that Gardener Shoot clusters are able to run WebAssembly workloads, giving users the chance to experiment and explore this cutting-edge technology.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>KubeCon / CloudNativeCon Europe 2024 Highlights</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/blog/2024/04-05-kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe-2024-highlights/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/blog/2024/04-05-kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe-2024-highlights/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://gardener.cloud/__resources/kubecon-eu2024_7db2c6.png" alt="KubeCon EU 2024 Keynote Room" title="KubeCon EU 2024 Keynote Room">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2024, recently held in Paris, was a testament to the robustness of the open-source community and its pivotal role in driving advancements in AI and cloud-native technologies. With a record attendance of over +12,000 participants, the conference underscored the ubiquity of cloud-native architectures and the business opportunities they provide.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ai-everywhere">AI Everywhere&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>LLMs and GenAI took center stage at the event, with discussions on challenges such as security, data management, and energy consumption. A popular quote stated, &amp;ldquo;If #inference is the new web application, #kubernetes is the new web server&amp;rdquo;. The conference emphasized the need for more open data models for AI to democratize the technology. Cloud-native platforms offer advantages for AI innovation, such as packaging models and dependencies as Docker packages and enhancing resource management for proper model execution. The community is exploring AI workload management, including using CPUs for inferencing and preprocessing data before handing it over to GPUs. CNCF took the initiative and put together an &lt;a href="https://www.cncf.io/reports/cloud-native-artificial-intelligence-whitepaper/">AI whitepaper&lt;/a> outlining the apparent synergy between cloud-native technologies and AI.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
