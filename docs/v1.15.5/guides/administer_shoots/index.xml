You have access to the Gardener dashboard and have permissions to create projects. Before you can provision and access a Kubernetes cluster on Azure, you need to add the account credentials in Gardener. Gardener needs the credentials to provision and operate the Azure infrastructure for your Kubernetes cluster.
Ensure that the account has the contributor role.</description></item><item><title>Manage DNS Providers</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/v1.15.5/guides/administer_shoots/dns_providers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/v1.15.5/guides/administer_shoots/dns_providers/</guid><description>DNS Providers Introduction Gardener can manage DNS records on your behalf, so that you can request them via different resource types (see here) within the shoot cluster. The domains for which you are permitted to request records, are however restricted and depend on the DNS provider configuration.
Shoot provider By default, every shoot cluster is equipped with a default provider. It is the very same provider that manages the shoot cluster&amp;rsquo;s kube-apiserver public DNS record (DNS address in your Kubeconfig).</description></item><item><title>Request DNS Names</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/v1.15.5/guides/administer_shoots/dns_names/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/v1.15.5/guides/administer_shoots/dns_names/</guid><description>Request DNS Names in Shoot Clusters Introduction Within a shoot cluster, it is possible to request DNS records via the following resource types:
Ingress Service DNSEntry It is necessary that the Gardener installation your shoot cluster runs in is equipped with a shoot-dns-service extension. This extension uses the seed&amp;rsquo;s dns management infrastructure to maintain DNS names for shoot clusters. Please ask your Gardener operator if the extension is available in your environment.</description></item><item><title>Request X.509 Certificates</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/v1.15.5/guides/administer_shoots/request_cert/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/v1.15.5/guides/administer_shoots/request_cert/</guid><description>Request X.509 Certificates Introduction Dealing with applications on Kubernetes which offer service endpoints (e.g. HTTP) may also require you to enable a secured communication via SSL/TLS. Gardener let&amp;rsquo;s you request a commonly trusted X.509 certificate for your application endpoint. Furthermore, Gardener takes care about the renewal process for your requested certificate.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get the basics straight first. If this is too long for you, you can read below how to get certificates by</description></item><item><title>Trigger Shoot operations</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/v1.15.5/guides/administer_shoots/trigger-shoot-operations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/v1.15.5/guides/administer_shoots/trigger-shoot-operations/</guid><description>Trigger shoot operations You can trigger a few explicit operations by annotating the Shoot with an operation annotation. This might allow you to induct certain behavior without the need to change the Shoot specification. Some of the operations can also not be caused by changing something in the shoot specification because they can&amp;rsquo;t properly be reflected here.
Please note: If .spec.maintenance.confineSpecUpdateRollout=true then the only way to trigger a shoot reconciliation is by setting the reconcile operation, see below.</description></item></channel></rss>
