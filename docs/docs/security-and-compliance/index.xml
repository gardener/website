We offer Gardener adopters the opportunity to show compliance with DISA Kubernetes STIG via the compliance checker tool &lt;a href="https://github.com/gardener/diki">diki&lt;/a>. The latest release in machine readable format can be found in the &lt;a href="https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/?_dl_facet_stigs=container-platform">STIGs Document Library&lt;/a> by searching for Kubernetes.&lt;/p>

Some of them are secure-by-default, so your responsibility is to make sure that they are not changed. For your convenience, the requirements are grouped logically and per role:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Run DISA K8s STIGs Ruleset</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/docs/security-and-compliance/disa-k8s-stig-shoot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/docs/security-and-compliance/disa-k8s-stig-shoot/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="show-disa-k8s-stig-compliance-for-a-gardener-shoot-cluster">Show DISA K8s STIG Compliance for a Gardener Shoot Cluster&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#show-disa-k8s-stig-compliance-for-a-gardener-shoot-cluster" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;h3 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#introduction" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>This part covers the topic of showing compliance with the DISA K8s STIG for a Gardener shoot cluster. The guide features two providers - &lt;code>managedk8s&lt;/code> and &lt;code>garden&lt;/code>, both of which implement rules from the DISA K8s STIG ruleset.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>managedk8s&lt;/code> provider assumes that the user running the ruleset does not have access to the environment (the seed in this particular case), in which the control plane components reside.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gardener Compliance Report</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/docs/security-and-compliance/report/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/docs/security-and-compliance/report/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#overview" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Gardener aims to comply with public security standards and guidelines, such as the &lt;a href="https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/">Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) for Kubernetes from Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)&lt;/a>. The DISA Kubernetes STIG is a set of rules that provide recommendations for secure deployment and operation of Kubernetes. It covers various aspects of Kubernetes security, including the configurations of the Kubernetes API server and other components, cluster management, certificate management, handling of updates and patches.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Credential Rotation</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/docs/security-and-compliance/credential-rotation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/docs/security-and-compliance/credential-rotation/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="keys">Keys&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#keys" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>There are plenty of keys in Gardener.
The ETCD needs one to store resources like secrets encrypted at rest.
Gardener generates certificate authorities (CAs) to ensure secured communication between the various components and actors and service account tokens are signed with a dedicated key.
There is also an SSH key pair to allow debugging of nodes and the observability stack has its own passwords too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://gardener.cloud/docs/getting-started/features/images/keys.png" alt="keys">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All of these keys share a common property: they are managed by Gardener.
Rotating them, however, is potentially very disruptive.
Hence, Gardener does not do it automatically, but offers you means to perform these tasks easily.
For a single cluster, you may conveniently use the dashboard.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Regional Restrictions</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/docs/security-and-compliance/regional-restrictions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/docs/security-and-compliance/regional-restrictions/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="shared-responsibility-model">Shared Responsibility Model&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#shared-responsibility-model" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Gardener, like most cloud providers&amp;rsquo; Kubernetes offerings, is dedicated for a global setup. And just like how most cloud providers offer means to fulfil regional restrictions, Gardener also has some means built in for this purpose. Similarly, Gardener also follows a shared responsibility model where users are obliged to use the provided Gardener means in a way which results in compliance with regional restrictions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="regions">Regions&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#regions" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Gardener users need to understand that Gardener is a generic tool and has no built-in knowledge about regions as geographical or political conglomerates. For Gardener, regions are only strings. To create regional restrictions is an obligation of all Gardener users who orchestrate existing Gardener functionality to reach evidence which can be audited later on.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
