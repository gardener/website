Mounting an S3 bucket into a pod using FUSE allows you to access the data as if it were on the local disk. The mount is a pointer to an S3 location, so the data is never synced locally. Once mounted, any pod can read or even write from that directory without the need for explicit keys.</description></item></channel></rss>
