Please check your Seeds and remove any usage before upgrading to this Gardener version. #8833 ✨ [OPERATOR] The gardener-resource-manager deployment procedure was improved. Earlier, GRM was unnecessarily rolled during shoot reconciliation if worker nodes contained custom taints. #8835 2023/11/29 - v1.84 ReleaseDemo Agenda 📋 Presenter(s) Duration Topic Reference(s) @danielfoehrKn 10m ⬆️ Machine Image Version Update Strategies #8275 @plkokanov 5m 🤲🏻 node-exporter’s Textfile Collector #8721 @timuthy 5m 🔄 Improved Shoot Condition Handling #8736 @shafeeqes 5m 🎮 kube-controller-manager Controller Enablement Based on APIs #8763 @aaronfern 5m 🚥 cluster-autoscaler Metrics #8750 No Demo, But Still Worth Celebrating 🎉 🪓 [USER] A validation rule was added that forbids changing the primary DNS provider in .spec.dns.providers as soon as the Shoot was scheduled. #8761 🪓 [OPERATOR] ⚠️ The deprecated fields spec.settings.dependencyWatchdog.endpoint and spec.settings.dependencyWatchdog.probe have been removed from the Seed API. Please check your Seeds and remove any usage before upgrading to this Gardener version. #8747 🐛 [OPERATOR] During the restore phase of control plane migration, the machine-controller-manager is deployed with 0 replicas if it did not exist before or if it existed and was not scaled up yet. This fixes an issue that could cause the Shoot’s nodes to get recreated during control plane migration. #8742 ✨ [DEVELOPER] Vendoring has been removed from the project, i.e., there is no vendor folder anymore. #8775 2023/11/22 - v1.83 ReleaseDemo Agenda 📋 Presenter(s) Duration Topic Reference(s) @Kostov6 10m 🐛 Prevent Unintended etcd-backup Secret Deletions #8709 @AleksandarSavchev 10m 📑 Diki - Gardener Compliance Checker diki (repo) @shafeeqes 5m 🔎 API Server Runtime Config Validation #8695 @dimitar-kostadinov 15m 💾 Introduction To registry-cache Extension registry-cache (repo) No Demo, But Still Worth Celebrating 🎉 🐛 [OPERATOR] A bug has been fixed which caused ServiceAccounts related to garden access secrets for extensions to leak in the seed namespace in the garden cluster after uninstallation of said extensions. #8697 ✨ [OPERATOR] The .status.lastOperation in core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1.Seed and operator.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1.Garden resources is now only updated each 5s during a reconciliation.

Earlier, shoot clusters were assigned a constraint reporting a problem with a failurePolocy: Fail webhook acting on these objects. Now, only Endpoints in the kube-system and default namespaces are considered for this check. #8521 ✨ [OPERATOR] The MachineControllerManagerDeployment has been promoted to beta and is now enabled by default.

This could point towards an error on the node and that not all Gardener related configuration happened successfully. #8448 ✨ [OPERATOR] gardener-operator now refuses to start if operators attempt to downgrade or skip minor Gardener versions. Please see this document for more information. #8413 ✨ [DEVELOPER] The following golang dependencies have been upgraded, please consult the upstream release notes and this issue for guidance on upgrading your golang dependencies when vendoring this gardener version: k8s.io/* to v0.28.2, sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime to v0.16.2. #8464 2023/09/13 - v1.79 ReleaseDemo Agenda 📋 Presenter(s) Duration Topic Reference(s) @ary1992 10m 🎮 sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime@v0.15 Upgrade #8245 @oliver-goetz 10m 🫧 Additional Excess Capacity Reservation Configurations #8356 @ScheererJ 10m 👨🏼‍💻 Extension Admission Controllers In Local Setup #8311 No Demo, But Still Worth Celebrating 🎉 ✨ [USER] When the Kubernetes control plane version is at least v1.28, it is now possible to set the worker pool Kubernetes version to be at most three versions behind the control plane version.

Make sure to upgrade all existing clusters before upgrading to this Gardener version. #8087 🐛 [OPERATOR] gardener-resource-manager’s system-components-config webhook no longer adds the toleration for the ToBeDeletedByClusterAutoscaler taint to system components in shoot clusters. The ToBeDeletedByClusterAutoscaler taint is maintained by the cluster-autoscaler. This was breaking cluster-autoscaler’s drain mechanism when scaling down an under-utilized node. It was causing just evicted system components from to be deleted node to be scheduled again on the to be deleted node. #8172 2023/06/21 - v1.73 ReleaseDemo Agenda 📋 Presenter(s) Duration Topic Reference(s) @voelzmo 10m 📈 Disabled Scaling Classes For kube-apiserver Resource Requirements #8003 @dimitar-kostadinov 10m 🌍 Improved Robustness Of terraformer Executions #8059 @rfranzke 10m 🤖 machine-controller-manager Managed By gardenlet #8015, #8018, #8056 @shafeeqes 5m 🧹 Cleanup Secret Reference In ManagedSeeds #8039 No Demo, But Still Worth Celebrating 🎉 🪓 [OPERATOR] The field .spec.secretRef in the Seed API has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Gardener. #8064 ✨ [OPERATOR] gardener-apiserver now exposes a new core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1.InternalSecret API, see the documentation for more information. #8025 ✨ [DEVELOPER] It is now easier to annotate Services related to extensions serving webhook handlers that must be reached by kube-apiservers running in separate namespaces such that the respective network traffic gets allowed. Please refer to this guide for all information. […]. #8076 ✨ [DEVELOPER] gardenlet’s ControllerInstallation controller now populates the feature gate of gardenlet via the Helm values to extensions when they are getting installed. The information is populated via the .gardener.gardenlet.featureGates key. It contains a map whose keys are feature gates names and whose values are booleans (depicting the enablement status). #8011 2023/06/14 - v1.72 ReleaseDemo Agenda 📋 Presenter(s) Duration Topic Reference(s) @ScheererJ 5m 🔦 Virtual Garden API Server Exposure Via Istio #7953 @axel7born 5m 🐹 Golang Implementation For Egress Network Filtering shoot-networking-filter#64 @rfranzke 5m 📐 Improved Accuracy For Local Control Plane Migration E2E Tests #7981 @ishan16696 10m ⬆️ Improved ETCD Cluster Scale-Up etcd-druid#584 (issue) @kon-angelo 5m 🔧 Live AWS EBS Volume Modifications provider-aws#754 @elankath 5m 🔐 GCP Disk Encryption With Customer-Managed Keys provider-gcp#607 @MartinWeindel 5m 📀 OpenStack Manila CSI Driver provider-openstack#572 No Demo, But Still Worth Celebrating 🎉 🪓 [OPERATOR] It is required to have ControllerRegistrations for Kinds ControlPlane, Infrastructure and Worker with the same types used for seeds (.spec.provider.type).

[…] #7929 ✨ [DEVELOPER] In order to allow kube-apiserver pods of shoot or garden clusters to reach webhook servers, they must no longer be explicitly labeled with networking.resources.gardener.cloud/to-<service-name>-<protocol>-<port>=allowed. Instead, it is enough to annotate the Service of the webhook server with networking.resources.gardener.cloud/from-all-webhook-targets-allowed-ports=<ports>. #7907 📖 [DEVELOPER] A guideline for developers regarding TODO statements has been introduced. #7939 2023/05/31 - Hack The Garden Wrap UpDemo Agenda 📋 Presenter(s) Duration Topic Reference(s) @majst01, @Gerrit91 10m 🕵️ Introduction Of gardener-node-agent Summary @einfachnuralex 10m 🌐 IPv6 Shoot Clusters On Cloud Providers Summary @JensAc 10m 🌱 Experimenting With Masterful Shoot Clusters Summary @timebertt 10m 🔑 Garden Cluster Access For Extension Controllers In Seeds Summary @rfranzke 10m 💾 Replacing ShootStates With Backups in Backup Buckets Summary @timebertt 10m 🔐 New InternalSecrets API In Gardener Summary No Demo, But Still Worth Celebrating 🎉 ✨ The machine-controller-manager deployment procedure has been moved from the generic Worker actuator used in extensions controllers into gardenlet.
